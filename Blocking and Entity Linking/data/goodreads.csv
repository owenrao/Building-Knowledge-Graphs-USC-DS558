1,I Remember: Sketch for an Autobiography,"Boris Pasternak's autobiographical sketch is the most outspoken and heart-searching document a great poet has ever written. It takes courage to dismiss, as Pasternak does, most of his literary output of the twenty-odd years that followed the publication in 1914 of his first volume of verse, A Twin in the Clouds, with the dry remark, 'I do not like my style up to 1940'; but it takes even greater courage, knowing the sort of aura of sanctity that hangs over the name of Mayakovsky in the Soviet Union, to declare that he rejects half of Mayakovsky, or, even more bluntly, that Mayakovsky was being 'propagated' by the Communist Government 'like potatoes in the reign of Catherine the Great.'",0844627100,9780844627106,0,Boris Pasternak, , ,3.53,17,5,Peter Smith Publisher,,Hardcover,English,1000-2193746.I_Remember.html
2,Betty Boothroyd: Autobiography,"The enormous respect and affection of the British public for Betty Boothroyd has its roots in a strong belief in what she stands for—fair play, an unshakeable sense of honor, and a passionate belief in the sovereignty of Parliament. This is a candid account of Betty Boothroyd’s life in politics, and she speaks frankly of the devastation of losing two elections, of campaigning for JFK in America, and the elation she felt on finally becoming an MP in 1973. But her long political career reached its apogee in 1992 when she was appointed the first woman Speaker of the House of Commons. Detailing many of the true stories behind the headlines, she writes of the sleaze scandals that beset the Major government, her feelings when Labour won their landslide election in 1997, and her strongly held views on the role of Parliament.",0712679480,9780712679480,384,Betty Boothroyd, , ,3.60,20,3,Random House UK,November 1st 2002,Hardcover,English,1001-2155002.Betty_Boothroyd.html
3,"Caddie, A Sydney Barmaid: An Autobiography","Caddie, the Story of a Barmaid is the fictionally embellished autobiography of Catherine ""Caddie"" Edmonds, who worked as a barmaid in Sydney during the Great Depression. Published anonymously in 1953 under Edmonds' nickname, which was coined by a lover who likened her to ""the sleek body and class of his Cadillac motorcar"", Caddie attracted wide critical acclaim upon its original publication in London, and became a bestseller when it was adapted into a feature film in 1976, one year after International Women's Year. Author and origins The book's anonymous author, Catherine Beatrice Edmonds (1900–1960), was employed for some years from 1945 as a charwoman by authors Dymphna Cusack and Florence James at their cottage in the Blue Mountains. At the time, Cusack and James were working on their epic collaborative novel, Come In Spinner. Edmonds initially took the job in the hope that the authors would write her story. Entertained by Edmonds' turn of phrase and her stories of working as a barmaid during the Depression, Cusack and James encouraged and coached her through seven drafts of an autobiography until 1952.[1] Edmonds married Frederick George Holloway (represented as 'Jon Marsh' in the book) on 25 January 1919 at St Stephen's Church, Newtown. The couple had two children in the early years of the marriage: a son named Ronald, and a daughter named Catherine. The couple were divorced in Sydney on 20 December 1929. She married again on 24 February 1934 to Arthur John Baden Surenne at the Methodist Church at Marrickville. This marriage lasted until 1948 when the couple divorced. She later changed her surname by deed poll to Elliott-Mackay. Edmonds chose to write under a pseudonym because she was publicity-shy. John Ritchie's entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography describes her as plump, round-faced, with ""narrow, grey-blue eyes, 'wavy, light brown hair streaked with grey', and deeply-graven lines at the corners of her mouth"". Caddie Edmonds died of a heart attack on 16 April 1960 at her home in Regentville in Sydney. She was buried in Penrith General Cemetery and was survived by a son and a daughter.[2] Plot introduction The book follows the story of the nicknamed author, Caddie, from a brief outline of her childhood to her work as a barmaid and, later, SP bookmaking, during the Great Depression until the outbreak of World War II. During this time Caddie overcomes numerous hardships as she raises her two children without the support of family or her estranged husband, Jon Marsh. Plot summary The book tells the story of Caddie, starting with her birth in Penrith, New South Wales, in 1900 to a family living in poverty. They move to railway camps at Glenbrook in the Blue Mountains where her drunken father works as a railway fettler. His abuse becomes worse when her mother dies in childbirth and her brother is killed at the Gallipoli landing. To escape her family, she moves to Sydney to work as a shop assistant with her friend, Esther, while still a young woman. She meets and marries a middle-class man, Jon Marsh, and has two children by him. She feels constrained by the control taken by her mother-in-law, living next door, who treats her as undeserving of her son, as Caddie is not ""pure merino"" (i.e., with only free-settler, not convict, forebears). Caddie leaves when she discovers Jon's sexual relationship with Esther. Jon and his mother endeavour to retain custody of the children, although Caddie believes this is really only to spite her. Caddie moves to the first available cheap accommodation, only to find that the premises are mainly inhabited by prostitutes. Caddie finds better-paid work as a barmaid, a morally suspect position—her first employer tells her to shorten her dress, for example, because ""she was an artwork, and he liked his artwork on display."" She places her children in the care of a church-run home, having tried leaving them with carers who mistreated and neglected them. She visits weekly, often with her barmaid friend, Leslie. When the Depression hits, tips are less common and both women's incomes fall dramatically. Through Leslie, Caddie meets a Greek immigrant and business owner, Peter, with whom she establishes a loving relationship, with Peter buying gifts for weekend visits with Caddie's children. Caddie and Peter are distressed when Peter's estranged wife and ailing father call him back to Greece to run the family business. The couple corresponds, with Peter reporting that his attempts to divorce his wife have been unsuccessful. With the effects of the Depression deepening, Caddie takes additional work by running tabs for the pub's SP bookmaker. She regains custody of her children and rents a house, furnishing it with fruit cases for chairs. She befriends Bill ""the Rabbittoh"" (rabbit seller), Sonny his brother and their parents, and Bill helps her sign up for the dole (sustenance food provisions meant for those without income). Caddie saves some money when she starts running the SP books herself, the bookmaker having moved on to legal bookmaking at the racecourse. Caddie decides to leave the city, having been offered work on a farm. She moves house to share with Bill the rabbittoh for a week, to save rent before moving to mountains for other work, but remains there when the work offer is withdrawn. She emotionally supports, and is supported by, Bill's family, including caring for his elderly father before his death. Around this time, Peter's wife dies, and Peter asks Caddie to migrate. Caddie feels unable to do this, but Peter is tied to Greece to keep the business alive. You'll have to read the book to see what happens from here! Major themes The book documents one woman's version of her experiences of the Great Depression, highlighting her battle to maintain her respectability while ensuring she can support her children. At the time, Australian bars were segregated on gender lines, so the barmaid was the only female present in the main bar. As a result, barmaids had a bad name because a woman working in such conditions was regarded as morally suspect, perhaps luring men into spending their money in bars, perhaps soliciting commercial sex. Indeed, Caddie makes reference to the numerous sexual advances made towards her, both in her role as barmaid and in situations where it would benefit her, such as from the teacher at her children's school. She shows how she remained morally respectable in this regard, and shows how her other illegal activities - SP bookmaking, signing up for multiple welfare payments - were for the benefit of her family and friends. The story makes reference to the six o'clock swill, written at a time shortly after the war when it was presumed that the reader would be familiar with the phenomenon. In an effort to minimise alcohol consumption, the Australian government legislated that bars were to close at 6pm. The result was an extreme rush between 5pm and 6pm. Cusack notes how Caddie was reluctant to give any signs of complaint, but to take everything in her stride in order to meet the needs of her children. Cusack had Caddie rewrite the book several times in order to give more detail of the difficulties she faced and her feelings about them. The stoic strength of an Australian single woman ""battler"" is an underlying theme to the story. Publishing details The book was published in May 1953 by Constable & Co. Ltd in London to glowing reviews. By September it had been reprinted three times, although, at this stage, it was not a best seller. It was eventually published in Australia in 1966. The film adaptation in 1976 led to a resurgence in the book's popularity and bestseller status, with seven reprints that year, sixteen years after Caddie's death.",0725100141,9780725100148,199,Caddie, , ,3.62,24,2,Sun Books,1966,Unknown Binding, ,1002-4475340-caddie-a-sydney-barmaid.html

7,Autobiography: My Story,"From a council house in Kent to her first home in the Hollywood hills, from being told she was too big to model to becoming an inspiration for curvy girls everywhere, Kelly's life has taken many unexpected turns. She dreamed of escaping her chaotic childhood by becoming an actress—she never imagined she'd become a hugely popular pin-up girl who would pose in Playboy and date some of the most attractive men in the world, or that her tempestuous relationships with the likes of Jason Statham and Billy Zane would be played out in the merciless glare of the media. Now, in her compelling autobiography, Kelly writes with total honesty about the men she has loved and the tragic loss and heartache she has overcome, as well as introducing readers to her world—that of a model, actress, presenter, and business woman. This is the real Kelly. The girl behind the gloss. A funny, feisty woman who lives life on her own terms.",0283071990,9780283071997,256,Kelly Brook, , ,3.37,19,3,Pan Macmillan,December 1st 2014,Hardcover, ,1006-22891744-autobiography.html
8,Jenny Pitman: The Autobiography,"To use modern parlance, Jenny Pitman OBE faced a double whammy when she applied for her trainer's licence. First, she was an outsider to the world of racing; second, and more importantly, she was a woman in what was still very much a man's world. As she tells us in her frank and entertaining autobiography, simply titled Jenny Pitman , she overcame the first problem much easier than beating the second. Known throughout the equine world as the first woman of racing, Mrs Pitman--now Mrs Stait after marrying her long-time partner David Stait in early 1998--is still having to bang her head against the brick wall that is sex discrimination. She tells how, after entering a fitness regime at the beginning of 1998 and looking and feeling better than she had for years, a male colleague asked whether or not her sex life had improved as she appeared so fit and healthy! But racing has been Jenny Pitman's life and the book is a no-holds barred account of a truly remarkable career. After telling of her happy childhood as the middle child of seven spent on a Leicestershire farm run by her parents, she describes the happiness she felt at her teenage marriage to jockey Richard Pitman. That joy was to turn to tears 10 years later when her first husband, and father of Jenny's two boys Mark and Paul, twice walked out on her. However, the outwardly tough-as-teak Jenny gritted her teeth and got on with the job of training racehorses. Jenny has achieved success in the world's toughest races and she fully describes the joy and heartbreak of landing two (it should have been three but Esha Ness's success came in the 1993 void race) Grand Nationals. Then there were the other Grand Nationals, the Scottish, Welsh and finally to complete the set, Irish versions of the event. In 1984 she became the only woman to train a Cheltenham Gold Cup winner and followed that up when the same horse, Burrough Hill Lad, became the first trained by a woman to land the coveted Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup. That was a record which stood until Venetia Williams took 1998's running. It is a frank book which covers and fully explains her run-ins with officialdom, press and even jockeys. The lead-up to her spat with Jamie Osborne is fully explained, as are the reasons behind her famous letter to Aintree officials over the state of the ground at 1998's Grand National. All in all, an enjoyable and informative read in which Mrs Pitman, as usual, pulls no punches.",1852252545,9781852252540,320,Jenny Pitman, , ,4.10,21,4,Partridge Press,November 5th 1998,Hardcover,English,1007-2966832-jenny-pitman.html

10,A Man Called White: The Autobiography of Walter White,"First published in 1948, A Man Called White is the autobiography of the famous civil rights activist Walter White during his first thirty years of service to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. White joined the NAACP in 1918 and served as its executive secretary from 1931 until his death in 1955. His recollections tell not only of his personal life, but amount to an insider's history of the association's first decades.Although an African American, White was fair-skinned, blond-haired, and blue-eyed. His ability to pass as a white man allowed him--at great personal risk--to gather important information regarding lynchings, disfranchisement, and discrimination. Much of A Man Called White recounts his infiltration of the country's white-racist power structure and the numerous legal battles fought by the NAACP that were aided by his daring efforts. Penetrating and detailed, this autobiography provides an important account of crucial events in the development of race relations before 1950--from the trial of the ""Scottsboro Boys"" to an investigation of the treatment of African American servicemen in World War II, from the struggle against the all-white primaries in the South to court decisions--at all levels--on equal education.",0820316989,9780820316987,392,Walter Francis White,Andrew Young, ,3.95,21,2,University of Georgia Press,February 1st 1995,Paperback,English,1009-1629320.A_Man_Called_White.html
11,Call Me Anna: The Autobiography of Patty Duke,"The Star--The public saw her as a gifted child star: the youngest actor to win an Oscar for her role as Helen Keller in The Miracle Worker and the youngest actor to have a prime-time television series bearing her own name. The Nightmare--What the public did not see was Anna Marie Duke, a young girl whose life changed forever at age seven when tyrannical mangers stripped her of nearly all that was familiar, beginning with her name. She was deprived of family and friends. Her every word was programmed, her every action monitored and criticized. She was fed liquor and prescription drugs, taught to lie to get work, and relentlessly drilled to win roles. The Legend--Out of this nightmare emerged Patty Duke, a show business legend still searching for the child, Anna. She won three Emmy Awards and divorced three husbands. A starring role in Valley of the Dolls nearly ruined her career. She was notorious for wild spending sprees, turbulent liaisons, and an uncontrollable temper. Until a long hidden illness was diagnosed, and her amazing recovery recovery began. The Triumph-- Call Me Anna is an American success story that grew out of a bizarre and desperate struggle for survival. A harrowing, ultimately triumphant story told by Patty Duke herself--wife, mother, political activist, President of the Screen Actors Guild, and at last, a happy, fulfilled woman whose miracle is her own life.",0553272055,9780553272055,311,Patty Duke,Kenneth Turan, ,3.86,2205,61,Bantam,May 1st 1988,Paperback,English,101-213548.Call_Me_Anna.html

In 2005, Fossett made the first solo, non-stop, non-refueled circumnavigation of the world at the helm of what has been described as ""a fuel tank with room for one""—the Virgin Atlantic Global Flyer. But what made someone like Steve give up a secure, well-paid job in the financial sector for the romantic, yet increasingly dangerous, world of the adventurer?

20,Mostly on the Edge: An Autobiography,"He left school at fifteen to work as a reporter and wound up, just a few years later, as associate editor at Newsweek. He helped William F. Buckley Jr. found the National Review, worked closely with Joseph McCarthy, and became chief speechwriter for Barry Goldwater. But true to a conscience that caused him to question the claims and authority of others, Hess eventually rejected conservatism and embraced the libertarian politics of the New Left. He dabbled with drugs, rode motorcycles, worked with the Black Panthers, got arrested while protesting the war in Viet Nam, and published an article in Playboy that defined libertarianism and ignited a national debate. As an anti-Communist he cooperated with the FBI, but as a libertarian he fought the IRS until he was nearly destitute. Whatever his political leanings, he always despised conceit, exploded intolerance, and embraced life to the fullest. He was a man who traveled in influential circles, often close to power, but, in his own words, ""mostly on the edge."" Karl Hess participated in many of the defining events of 20th-century America, a self-taught boy who became a self-made journalist. Mostly on the Edge chronicles the life education of Hess, who became a defiant tester of the prevailing ideas of each decade. He lived by trial and error, and was always willing to acknowledge his mistakes. Like Franklin and Thoreau, Hess hoped to wake up America by questioning the moral majority, fighting the Kafkaesque intrusions of government, and encouraging his family, friends, and highly influential colleagues to think for themselves. Hess provides eyewitness accounts, unique personal observations, startling and valuable insights on leadership and dissent, and, in the end, leaves behind a clear path to realizing the dream of freedom.",1573926876,9781573926874,409,Karl Hess, , ,4.58,12,2,Prometheus Books,April 1st 1999,Hardcover,English,1018-1752875.Mostly_on_the_Edge.html

It is original, startling writing."" - Sonja Yelich. ""Autobiography of a Marguerite is a grand achievement. The writing goes to the aching heart of disconnection and of longing for repair.

35,The Three Mountains: The Autobiography of Samael Aun Weor,"For the first time in the history of humanity, the path of Initiation has been explained from beginning to end. In this work Samael Aun Weor explains the essential outline of the Direct Path to the realization of the Being. The Direct Path is the only way to reach the heights of spiritual development, and was indicated with precision by Jesus of Nazareth: ""Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few."" - Matthew 7:13 ""Without wanting to hurt delicate susceptibilities in any way, we must emphasize the basic idea that a variety of venerable institutions coexist within the cultural-spiritual environment of contemporary humanity that very sincerely believe they know the Secret Path. Nonetheless, they do not know it. In all the books of ancient times, the Secret Path is cited. This Path is quoted and mentioned in many verses; yet people do not know it. Beloved reader, to unveil, to show and to teach the esoteric path that leads to the Final Liberation is certainly the purpose of this book that you have in your hands. This is one of the books of the Fifth Gospel. The great German initiate Goethe wrote, ""Every theory is gray and only the tree of the golden fruits of life is green."" Certainly, what we deliver in this new book are transcendental lived experiences. It is what we have verified, what we have directly experienced."" - Samael Aun Weor",1934206288,9781934206287,415,Samael Aun Weor, , ,4.70,40,1,Thelema Press,January 1st 2007,Paperback,English,1031-4904417-the-three-mountains.html

47,Service of Ladies: An Autobiography,"Ulrich von Liechtenstein's extraordinary account of his adventures as a knight-errant is one of the most vivid images of chivalric life to have come down to us. His knightly autobiography was written in the mid-thirteenth century, and gives an account of the 'journey of Venus' which he undertook in 1226 in honour of his lady, in which he claimed to have broken 307 spears in jousts against all comers in the space of a month. Some of it is obviously quietly exaggerated, written for his friends' entertainment many years later, and he is not above a sly dig at the conventions of courtly love, but he completely accepts its basic ideas. It is full of lively episodes and good stories, as well as verses in honour of his lady; if the tale has been polished up for effect, it is nonetheless a thoroughly entertaining account of how a knight saw his ideal career in the jousting field. If the name is unexpectedly familiar to modern readers, it is because it was borrowed by the hero of the film 'A Knight's Tale'; Ulrich would have certainly approved of his exploits.

His inter-county career took off in the late 1990s, when he picked up a Munster minor championship medal in 1997 and another at under-21 level in 1999. But it was in the senior team throughout the 2000s that Paul came into his own. In a period defined by great rivalry with Tyrone, he became a key playmaker for Kerry, never failing to give his all in pursuit of victory. Over the course of a career marked by courage, physicality and an intense passion for the Green and Gold, there were many glorious days. There were other days too, with controversial incidents that led to a number of suspensions, most notably in 2008, the year in which Paul also had the honour of being the Kerry captain. 2009 brought redemption. But 2010 presented new challenges. In this fiercely honest autobiography, Paul offers – in his own words – a compelling, unflinching account of a career that has fascinated football fans for over a decade.",, ,274,Paul Galvin, , ,3.91,22,1,Transworld Digital,October 30th 2014,Kindle Edition,English,1057-23517831-in-my-own-words.html

65,Autobiography of Envelopes,"Poetry. Begun in the turmoil of moving house, these poems were jotted on envelopes because that was the form of paper on hand. But there was more to this choice. Oscillating between the US, France and Morocco, living on three continents and in three languages, Sarah Riggs felt the need to address her own self in order not to disperse into alternatives. But how do we address ourselves? the book asks. How many selves do we have? How do we sort what we think from what has been thought for us? Is it that our language cannot follow the mind's rich, fluctuating process or does language outrun what the mind can seize? So that we are caught between two excesses, two ineffables?""In these brief, crisp and thought-provoking stanzas, Sarah Riggs investigates notions of address and possibilities of correspondences. The poems turn to and around, tango with written and other characters...and ask about the nature of character. They are highly observant and finely tuned time pieces, with poetry's insistent concerns of number, counting, what counts and what it may mean to count. This work offers so many tantalizing, illuminated options and questions as to continuity and duration. Here, instant after instant, at once stunning and muted, mutably, 'The poem addresses itself. We open, listen, magnify.'""--Stacy Doris",1936194104,9781936194100,160,Sarah Riggs, , ,3.14,7,0,Burning Deck,September 15th 2012,Paperback,English,1059-15037872-autobiography-of-envelopes.html

72,"In the Beginning, Woman Was the Sun: The Autobiography of a Japanese Feminist","""In the beginning, woman was truly the sun. An authentic person. Now she is the moon, a wan and sickly moon, dependent on another, reflecting another's brilliance.""-Hiratsuku Raicho Raicho Hiratsuka (1886-1971) was the most influential figure in the early women's movement in Japan. In 1911, she founded ""Bluestocking"" (""Seito""), Japan's first literary journal run by women. In 1920, she founded the New Women's Association, Japan's first nationwide women's organization to campaign for female suffrage, and soon after World War II, the Japan Federation of Women's Organizations. Available for the first time in English, ""In the Beginning, Woman Was the Sun"" is Raicho Hiratsuka's autobiography of her childhood, early youth, and subsequent rebellion against the strict social codes of the time. Hiratsuka came from an upper-middle class Tokyo family, and her restless quest for truth led her to read widely in philosophy and undertake Zen training at Japan Woman's College. After graduation, she gained brief notoriety for her affair with a married writer, but quickly established herself as a brilliant and articulate leader of feminist causes with the launch of the journal ""Seito."" Her richly detailed account presents a woman who was at once idealistic and elitist, fearless and vain, and a perceptive observer of society. Teruko Craig's translation captures Hiratsuka's strong personality and distinct voice. At a time when interest in Japanese feminism is growing in the West, there is no finer introduction to Japanese women's history than this intimate, candid, and compelling memoir.",023113813X,9780231138130,335,Hiratsuka Raicho,Teruko Craig, ,3.60,10,1,Columbia University Press,March 5th 2010,Paperback,English,1065-8263265-in-the-beginning-woman-was-the-sun.html

By thirteen she had already published a novel (The House Without Windows, Knopf, 1927), and with the publication of her second novel a year later, she seemed launched on a literary career. Then the events of her inner life and her outer world seemed to conspire against her vivid energy—the separation of her parents, the Great Depression, her own frustrating and unhappy marriage. Finally she fulfilled a prophetic vein in her writings, which sought flight from the human world to an enchanted, unspoiled world of nature.

With a sharp eye for the absurd and in her own unique voice she tells her story for the first time. What possessed her to become a professional comedian in the cut-throat world of stand-up comedy after ten years as a psychiatric nurse? How did she deal with late night drunken audiences? Raised in middle class comfort, she left home in her teens to live with someone entirely inappropriate. Her parents were aghast at her behaviour and attempted to rein in her excesses, finally giving up when she demonstrated that she was not headed for the life of a nun. From her early years growing up in a small south coast town with two brothers who toughened her up, to emerging on stage as 'The Sea Monster', Jo Brand tells it like it is with wit, candour and a wonderful sense that life can be ridiculous but that there is always a funny side",0755355253,9780755355259,340,Jo Brand, , ,3.62,933,73,Headline Review,April 1st 2010,Paperback,English,1069-6968267-look-back-in-hunger.html

""On balance,"" Krantz concludes, ""sex and shopping are both excellent things""--and she's had plenty of both. In her opening chapter, on the night train to Paris in 1949, about-to-be-21-year-old Judy Tarcher realizes, ""Now that I was old enough to vote, I was old enough to lose my virginity."" Thirty-three years later, when her husband wants to reach her in a hurry, he knows her habits well enough to find her in Beverly Hills, ""dallying at the Saint Laurent boutique."" In between, Krantz offers a frank account of her affluent childhood in New York City; college years at Wellesley; premarital affairs that led to a 1953 abortion (about which she is matter-of-fact and guilt-free); marriage to television executive Steve Krantz; and, of course, the string of bestsellers that began with Scruples , published when she was 50. Although Krantz settles a few scores (mostly with carping critics) in her blunt narrative, by and large it describes with infectious gusto a glamorous life enjoyed to the hilt. --Wendy Smith",0312273282,9780312273286,352,Judith Krantz, , ,3.55,31,5,St Martins Pr,September 30th 2007,Paperback, ,1070-179790.Sex_And_Shopping.html

80,I Never Had It Made: An Autobiography,"The Autobiography of a Boy of Summer Who Became a Man for All Seasons Before Barry Bonds, before Reggie Jackson, before Hank Aaron, baseball's stars had one undeniable trait in common: they were all white. In 1947, Jackie Robinson broke that barrier, striking a crucial blow for racial equality and changing the world of sports forever. I Never Had It Made is Robinson's own candid, hard-hitting account of what it took to become the first black man in history to play in the major leagues. I Never Had It Made recalls Robinson's early years and influences: his time at UCLA, where he became the school's first four-letter athlete; his army stint during World War II, when he challenged Jim Crow laws and narrowly escaped court martial; his years of frustration, on and off the field, with the Negro Leagues; and finally that fateful day when Branch Rickey of the Brooklyn Dodgers proposed what became known as the ""Noble Experiment""—Robinson would step up to bat to integrate and revolutionize baseball. More than a baseball story, I Never Had It Made also reveals the highs and lows of Robinson's life after baseball. He recounts his political aspirations and civil rights activism; his friendships with Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, William Buckley, Jr., and Nelson Rockefeller; and his troubled relationship with his son, Jackie, Jr. Originally published the year Robinson died, I Never Had It Made endures as an inspiring story of a man whose heroism extended well beyond the playing field.",, ,320,Jackie Robinson, , ,3.83,766,103,Ecco,March 19th 2013,Kindle Edition,English,1072-18276073-i-never-had-it-made.html

Long before Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique was published, Anderson was writing about abortion, child care, custody arrangements, and pay equity.

We learn of her turbulent early years in Depression-era Alberta and her sometimes frustrating efforts to establish herself as a professional journalist in Toronto in the 1940s. We are given a behind-the-scenes look at her often stormy years with Maclean Hunter and at her decades-long editorship of Chatelaine. We experience her struggles as head of the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women and her fight to have one simple statement enshrined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms: that men and women are equal under the law.

There was an agonising pause, and then the timekeeper announced the record: three minutes, fifty-nine point four seconds. But no one heard anything after that first word – ‘three’. One of the most iconic barriers of sport had been broken, and Roger Bannister had become the first man to run a mile in under four minutes. To this day, more men have conquered Mount Everest than have achieved what the slender, unassuming student managed that afternoon. Sixty years on and the letters still arrive on Roger Bannister’s doormat, letters testifying to the enduring appeal of the four-minute mile and the example it set for the generation of budding athletes who were inspired to attempt the impossible. In this frank memoir, Sir Roger tells the full story of the talent and dedication that made him not just one of the most celebrated athletes of the last century but also a distinguished doctor, neurologist and one of the nation’s best-loved public figures. With characteristically trenchant views on drugs in sport, the nature of modern athletics and record breaking, the extraordinary explosion in running as a leisure activity, and the Olympic legacy, this rare and brilliant autobiography gives a fascinating insight into the life of a man who has lived life to the fullest.",184954686X,9781849546867,384,Roger Bannister, , ,3.79,14,4,Biteback,April 17th 2014,Hardcover,English,1084-21951193-twin-tracks.html

123,The Best that I Can Be: An Autobiography,"Rafer Johnson's story is the classic American dream: hard work leading to success, honor, and glory. Here, he openly writes about his humble beginnings in an obscure African American Texas ghetto, his growing up in the all-white, sun-drenched Californian town of Kingsburg, and his time at UCLA as the president of the student body and an acclaimed athlete. His talents brought him to dramatic athletic duels in Moscow, Melbourne, and Rome, and to the glamour of acting, broadcasting, and politics in Hollywood, Washington, D.C., and the rest of the nation. Structured around the ten events of the decathlon, Rafer's memoir vividly describes an exceptional life. It introduces remarkable people, both unknown and celebrated (the Kennedy family; Gloria Steinem; Bill Bright, founder of Campus Crusade; Tom Brokaw; and others), who befriended Rafer and affected his life. It tells of obstacles and tragedies--crippling injuries, an alcoholic father, the assassination of his close friend Robert F. Kennedy--and what it takes to overcome them. With tact, integrity, and acute observation, Rafer Johnson shares the intimate moments that have shaped his life and the lives of others. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",0385487614,9780385487610,304,Rafer Johnson, , ,4.33,9,2,WaterBrook Press,August 17th 1999,Paperback,English,1111-695927.The_Best_that_I_Can_Be.html

126,"Autobiography of Mark Twain: The Authentic, Original Version","""We are all alike, on the inside.""- Mark Twain ""All modern American literature,"" said Ernest Hemingway, ""comes from one book by Mark Twain called 'Huckleberry Finn.'"" Many Americans know Twain as the author of ""Tom Sawyer"" and ""Huckleberry Finn,"" books they think of as belonging only in the children's sections of libraries. But few know the private tragedies that haunted Twain, or that he was one of the fiercest advocates for progressive social causes like civil rights for African-Americans and voting rights for women. Mark Twain developed his convictions slowly, over a lifetime, very much like America itself did. Within your hands is a glimpse into the life, mind, soul, and ""truth"" of this cherished American icon. This uncensored autobiography is not only a legacy he left behind, but also a gift to all. Born Samuel Langhorne Clemens in 1835 in Florida, Missouri, Twain wrote prolifically, publishing novels, travelogues, newspaper articles, short stories, and political pamphlets. His best-known works are The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885). Written while America was still recovering from the Civil War and adjusting to the abolition of slavery, Twain's two best-known Mississippi River adventure tales also measure the depth of America's new economic and social realities. His most personal and insightful writing came when he created his, ""Final (and Right) Plan""-a free-flowing biography of the thoughts and interests he had toward the end of his life as he spoke his ""whole frank mind"". Along with the plan, came the instruction that the enclosed autobiography writings not be published in book form until 100 years after his death. Now, 100 years after his death, we do just that, in honor of the life and writings of Mark Twain-to reacquaint ourselves with the wit, wisdom, and ideals of this legendary American icon.",, ,202,Mark Twain, , ,4.37,19,2, , ,Kindle Edition,English,1114-10350585-autobiography-of-mark-twain.html

Now, in his long overdue autobiography, Rolf Harris charts his rise from the dusty streets of Bassendean in Western Australia, to becoming a household name on both sides of the world.

132,Through Thick and Thin: My Autobiography,"With his infectious energy and charisma, Gok Wan has an incredible gift of making women feel more confident within themselves - but it's not until you read his own inspirational story that you find out where he got that gift from. Gok grew up on a Leicester housing estate, with a loving family who ran a Chinese restaurant. For his parents, food meant love - and Gok was so well loved that by the time he was a teenager he weighed 21 stone. Being Asian and gay as well, Gok felt lonely and out of place. He was an easy target for bullies and suffered terribly at their hands. In a moment of inspiration, he decided to reinvent himself with his first style makeover and a larger-than-life personality to go with it. But his next move was to lose a devastating ten stone in nine months. In Through Thick and Thin , for the first time, Gok reveals all about that life changing period.

133,Viper Pilot: The Autobiography of One of America's Most Decorated F-16 Combat Pilots,"151 combat missions 21 hard kills on surface-to-air-missile sites 4 Distinguished Flying Crosses with Valor 1 Purple Heart Sure to rank as one of the greatest aviation memoirs ever written, Viper Pilot is an Air Force legend's thrilling eyewitness account of modern air warfare From 1986 to 2006, Lt. Col. Dan Hampton was a leading member of the Wild Weasels, the elite Air Force fighter squadrons whose mission is recognized as the most dangerous job in modern air combat. Weasels are the first planes sent into a war zone, flying deep behind enemy lines purposely seeking to draw fire from surface-to-air missiles and artillery. They must skillfully evade being shot down—and then return to destroy the threats, thereby making the skies safe for everyone else to follow. Today these vital missions are more hazardous than direct air-to-air engagement with enemy aircraft. Hampton's record number of strikes on high-value targets make him the most lethal F-16 Wild Weasel pilot in American history. This is his remarkable story. Taught to fly at an early age by his father, Hampton logged twenty years and 608 combat hours in the world's most iconic fighter jet: the F-16 ""Fighting Falcon,"" or ""Viper"" as its pilots call it. Hampton spearheaded the 2003 invasion of Iraq, leading the first flight of fighters over the border en route to strike Baghdad. In the war that followed, he engaged in a series of brilliantly executed missions that earned him three Distinguished Flying Crosses with Valor; he notably saved a U.S. Marine unit from certain death by taking out the surrounding enemy forces near Nasiriyah. Two years earlier, on 9/11, Hampton's father was inside the Pentagon when it was attacked; with his dad's fate unknown, Hampton was scrambled into American skies and given the unprecedented orders to shoot down any unidentified aircraft. Hampton also flew critical missions in the first Gulf War, served on the Air Combat Command staff during the Kosovo War, and was injured in the 1996 Khobar Towers terrorist attack. With manned missions rapidly giving way to remote-controlled UAV drones, Viper Pilot may be the last memoir by a true hero of the skies. Gripping and irreverently humorous, it is an unforgettable look into the closed world of fighter pilots and modern air combat.",006213034X,9780062130341,0,Dan Hampton, , ,4.00,812,97,William Morrow & Company,September 1st 2012,Paperback,English,1120-15924001-viper-pilot.html

In writing his memoirs Higgins exposes the sources for many of his best novels, from Scenes from a Receding Past to Langrishe, Go Down , giving the reader a rare look into the ""story behind the story.""

139,The Autobiography and Sex Life of Andy Warhol,"""Village Voice"" and ""Interview"" cofounder John Wilcock was first drawn into the milieu of Andy Warhol through filmmaker Jonas Mekas, assisting on some of Warhol's early films, hanging out at his parties and quickly becoming a regular at the Factory. ""About six months after I started hanging out at the old, silvery Factory on West 47th Street,"" he recalls, ""[Gerard] Malanga came up to me and asked, 'When are you going to write something about us?'"" Already fascinated by Warhol's persona, Wilcock went to work, interviewing the artist's closest associates, supporters and superstars. Among these were Malanga, Naomi Levine, Taylor Mead and Ultra Violet, all of whom had been in the earliest films; scriptwriter Ronnie Tavel, and photographer Gretchen Berg; art dealers Sam Green, Ivan Karp, Eleanor Ward and Leo Castelli, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Henry Geldzahler; the poets Charles Henri Ford and Taylor Mead, and the artist Marisol; and the musicians Lou Reed and Nico. Paul Morrissey supplied the title: ""The Autobiography and Sex Life of Andy Warhol"" is the first oral biography of the artist. First published in 1971, and pitched against the colorful backdrop of the 1960s, it assembles a prismatic portrait of one of modern art's least knowable artists during the early years of his fame. ""The Autobiography and Sex Life"" is likely the most revealing portrait of Warhol, being composite instead of singular; each of its interviewees offers a piece of the puzzle that was Andy Warhol. This new edition corrects the many errors of the first, and is beautifully designed in a bright, Warholian palette with numerous illustrations.The British-born writer John Wilcock cofounded ""The Village Voice"" in 1955, and went on to edit seminal publications such as ""The East Village Other,"" ""Los Angeles Free Press,"" ""Other Scenes"" and (in 1970) ""Interview,"" with Andy Warhol.",0970612613,9780970612618,256,John Wilcock,Christopher Trela,Harry Shunk,3.50,8,2,Trela Media,May 31st 2010,Hardcover,English,1126-7614414-the-autobiography-and-sex-life-of-andy-warhol.html

142,Eye to I: The Autobiography of a Photographer,"By turns acerbic, self-mocking, playful, even absurd, this autobiography deals with all Blumenfeld's subjects - his Jewish family, the Germans, the Vichy French, his models and New York publishers - with equal measures of wit, mockery and irony. He spares himself least of all. Born in turn-of-the-century Berlin, Blumenfeld was drafted in to serve in World War I, first as an ambulance driver (although he couldn't drive) and then as book-keeper at a field brothel, and was awarded the Iron Cross for giving his sergeant French lessons. Between the wars he was part of an avant-garde circle that included such artists as Else Lasker-Schuler and George Grosz and members of the Dada movement. During World War II, Blumenfeld was interned in a series of French camps, but eventually arrived in New York, where he found work with ""Vogue"" and ""Harper's Bazaar"".",050001907X,9780500019078,384,Erwin Blumenfeld,Mike Mitchell,Brian Murdoch,3.80,5,1,Thames & Hudson Ltd,June 14th 1999,Hardcover,English,1129-1615494.Eye_to_I.html
143,Elisabeth Sladen: The Autobiography,"A unique, insider's view of the world's longest running science fiction series, from one of the fans' favorite companions. David Tennant's foreword caps this warm, witty memoir—a fitting tribute to a woman who will be sadly missed by legions of fans. When Elisabeth Sladen first appeared as plucky journalist Sarah Jane Smith in 1973 Doctor Who story ""The Time Warrior,"" little did she know the character would become one of the most enduring and fondly remembered in the series' history. Here she shares the story of her years as Sarah Jane—traversing time and space alongside classic Doctors Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker, while a generation of children were terrified but transfixed as their heroine found herself menaced by Daleks, dinosaurs, Cybermen, man-eating alien flora, Egyptian mummies, extras in Bubble Wrap, and even the Loch Ness Monster. By the time she quit the TARDIS in 1976, making front page news, Elisabeth had become one of the most familiar faces of a TV golden age. But that wasn't the end of Sarah Jane. Elisabeth discusses the many times she has reprised her role—anniversary specials, a 1981 spin-off pilot with robotic sidekick K-9, and radio plays. She discusses touring the weird, wide, and wonderful world of Doctor Who fandom. And lastly, she shares details of Sarah Jane's most recent incarnation—when TV wunderkind Russell T. Davies approached her to come back again, this time to a Doctor Who backed by lavish budgets and garlanded with critical plaudits, how could she possibly say no? Funny, ridiculous, insightful, and entertaining, hers is the story of another girl, another planet, completed just months before she died.",1845134885,9781845134884,346,Elisabeth Sladen,David Tennant, ,4.41,394,78,Aurum Press Ltd,December 2nd 2011,Hardcover,English,113-6928115-elisabeth-sladen.html

149,Time and Space: A Poetic Autobiography,"Written while in exile in the United States, “Time” and “Space” were originally intended to appear together in a single volume. Not until 1986, however, did they appear so in Spanish— and not until 1988 were they published together in English. By presenting them together, Jiménez had wanted them to convey the same continuity of emotion, the same philosophical intensity, that he had experienced while writing them. “All My Life,” he wrote in his introduction, “I have toyed with the idea of writing a continuous poem...with no concrete theme, sustained only by its own surprise, its rhythm, its discoveries, its light, its successive joys; that is, its intrinsic elements, its essence.” That continuous poem is Time and Space the last book Jiménez wrote. Presented here in a bilingual edition, Time and Space will take readers of both English and Spanish on the longest and most sustained ride on the crest of poetry they will ever enjoy. “The greatest poem in this Century...” —Octavio Paz Antonio T. de Nicolás, translator and editor of Time and Space is also widely known for his highly acclaimed translation of the Juan Ramón Jiménez classic, Platero and I , as well as many other works in Spanish.

155,Terry Venables Autobiography,"After a playing career that spanned more than 15 years, and took in golden spells in the sixties and seventies with Chelsea and Spurs, it was almost inevitable that Terry Venables would move into management. Following early success with Crystal Palace and Queens Park Rangers, he was appointed to the plum job of managing Barcelona, one of the biggest clubs in Europe. The Spanish giants had been struggling, but he soon turned them around and brought them trophy success, which inevitably earned him the nickname 'El Tel'. He returned to England to take charge of Spurs, where he helped save the club from financial troubles, and formed an ill-fated partnership with Alan Sugar. Again there was trophy success, as Venables attracted top-rate England stars such as Paul Gascoigne, Gary Lineker and Chris Waddle to the club, and when the England job fell vacant, he was the obvious choice for the role, leading the nation to the semi-finals of Euro 96 where they lost out on a place in the final after a penalty shoot-out. His spell in charge of England ended soon after, since when he has worked in numerous different roles. Widely viewed as one of football's great tacticians, but with a charismatic and gregarious personality, Venables is out on his own as the greatest English manager of recent years, and his story is sure to fascinate and entertain all followers of the game.",1471129942,9781471129940,320,Terry Venables, , ,3.17,12,1,Simon & Schuster UK,May 22nd 2014,ebook, ,1140-18170775-terry-venables-autobiography.html
156,Autobiography,"Here is the autobiography of a remarkable man. Yukichi Fukuzawa's life covered the 66 years between 1835 and 1901, a period which comprised greater and more extraordinary changes than any other in the history of Japan. In his country's swift transformation from an isolated feudal state to a full-fledged member of the modern world, Fukuzawa played a leading role: he was the educator of the new Japan, the man who above all others explained to his countrymen the ideas behind the dazzling material evidence of Western civilization. Dictated by Fukuzawa in 1897, this book vividly relates his story, from his childhood as a member of the lower samurai class in a small, caste-bound village. His escape from the hopeless destiny decreed by his social position, his adventures as a student of Dutch (the language of the only Westerners allowed in Japan), his travels aboard the first Japanese ship to sail to America -- all prepared Fukuzawa to write Seiyo¯ Ji¯jo¯ (Things Western), the book which made him famous.

157,Autobiography,"William Rees-Mogg is one of the pivotal figures of postwar Britain. In this brilliantly entertaining memoir he recounts the story of a colorful life, and reflects on the key figures and events of his time. As editor of the Times (his glory years), journalist, commentator, chairman of the Arts Council, and, later, chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Council (when he was accused of censorship), William Rees-Mogg has spent his life at the center of events in politics and journalism. Often controversial and never dull, he has always had the courage to hold strong, fiercely defended opinions which go to the heart of the problems of the day. From his famous defense of Mick Jagger on a charge of possessing cannabis when he attacked the ""primitive"" impulse to ""break a butterfly on a wheel,"" to his recent criticism of the morality behind the war in Kosovo and defense of monetarism, his writing has demanded attention, to the point of becoming newsworthy in itself. He knew and knows most of the anybodies who were anybody, from royalty to prime ministers, presidents, business magnates, and religious leaders, and uses his unique insider perspective to great effect, with perceptive, sometimes provocative, recollections of people such as Rab Butler, Margaret Thatcher, Anthony Eden, Shirley Williams, Roy Jenkins, Robin Day, Rupert Murdoch, and many more. From an early age his life was filled with incidentamong the many anecdotes are the stories of Noel Coward's goldfish, his failure to inherit £30,000, his near-shooting at Trinity College, Oxford, an eventful stay at Chequers with Harold Wilson, conspiring with Shirley Williams against the Communists, his doomed attempts to enter politics, and dinner with Ronald Reagan and Harold Macmillan.",0002571838,9780002571838,352,William Rees-Mogg, , ,3.67,3,0,HarperCollins Publishers Ltd,August 1st 2011,Hardcover, ,1142-2404481.Autobiography.html

He tells of his family's increasing involvement in the struggle against apartheid, of disapproval and suspension from his own church. He relates a harrowing story of escalating harassment, detention and firebombing, torture and exile-and his return, despite death threats and further detention, to South Africa to continue the fight.

174,The Power: My Autobiography,"'The Power' is back. King of the oche and a legend in the game, Phil Taylor is largely responsible for taking darts into the 21st century. Recently crowned world champion for an unprecedented eleventh time, Taylor is a complete one-off -- the Tiger Woods of his sport -- and the most phenomenal player ever to throw a dart. Brought up in the back streets of the Potteries, where his Dad tried to turn him into a boxer, Taylor's first job saw him earning GBP75 a week in a factory making ceramic toilet handles -- and by the age of 25 he had hardly thrown a dart in anger. Then he attended an Eric Bristow darts exhibition, and the 'Crafty Cockney' became his mentor and friend and loaned him GBP10,000 to play the pro circuit. Within five years Taylor had won the first of his eleven world titles ... In his book, Taylor describes how Bristow coaxed, bullied, humiliated and often literally punched him into making it as a pro. memorable matches and recalling vivid stories featuring the likes of Bristow, Cliff Lazarenko (who once had 20 cans of lager before a match), John Lowe and the legendary Jocky Wilson. A dispute between the professional players and the British Darts Organisation in 1992 almost led to a dispirited Taylor giving up the game for good. And he retraces the worst six months of his life, during which time he was convicted of sexually assaulting two female fans and had his MBE rescinded. The pain for his family was hard to bear. This is a story of a man having to come to terms with unparalleled success in his professional life after a career setback that would have destroyed many others; a unique sportsman whose steely-eyed determination won him an unprecedented eleventh world title in 2004 in what many observers described as the best professional darts match in living memory.",0007168225,9780007168224,387,Sid Waddell, , ,3.47,15,1,McGraw-Hill/Osborne Media,January 5th 2004,Paperback,English,1158-2522267.The_Power.html

176,An Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments with Truth,"It is not my purpose to attempt a real autobiography. I simply want to tell the story of my numerous experiments with truth, and as my life consists of nothing but those experiments, it is true that the story will take the shape of an autobiography. ...Identification with everything that lives is impossible without self-purification; without self-purification, the observance of the law of Ahimsa must remain an empty dream; God can never be realised by one who is not pure of heart. Self-purification, therefore, must remain purification in all walks of life. And purification being highly infectious, purification of oneself necessarily leads to the purification of one's surroundings. But the path to self-purification is hard and steep. To attain perfect purity, one has to become absolutely passion-free in thought, speech and action; to rise above the opposing currents of love and hatred, attachment and repulsion. I know that I have not in me as yet the triple purity, in spite of constant ceaseless striving for it. That is why the world's praise fails to move me; indeed it very often stings me. To conquer the subtle passions seems to me far harder than the physical conquest of the world by the force of arms. Ever since my return to India, I have had experiences of the dormant passions lying hidden within me. The knowledge of them has made me feel humiliated though not defeated. The experiences and experiments have sustained me and given me great joy. But I know I still have before me a difficult path to traverse. I must reduce myself to zero. So long as a man does not of his own free will put himself last among his fellow creatures, there is no salvation for him. Ahimsa is the farthest limit of humility.

178,Not Being God: A Collaborative Autobiography,"Gianni Vattimo, a leading philosopher of the continental school, has always resisted autobiography. But in this intimate memoir, the voice of Vattimo as thinker, political activist, and human being finds its expression on the page. With Piergiorgio Paterlini, a noted Italian writer and journalist, Vattimo reflects on a lifetime of politics, sexual radicalism, and philosophical exuberance in postwar Italy. Turin, the city where he was born and one of the intellectual capitals of Europe (also the city in which Nietzsche went mad), forms the core of his reminiscences, enhanced by fascinating vignettes of studying under Hans Georg Gadamer, teaching in the United States, serving as a public intellectual and interlocutor of Habermas and Derrida, and working within the European Parliament to unite Europe. Vattimo's status as a left-wing faculty president paradoxically made him a target of the Red Brigades in the 1970s, causing him to flee Turin for his life. Left-wing terrorism did not deter the philosopher from his quest for social progress, however, and in the 1980s, he introduced a daring formulation called ""weak thought,"" which stripped metaphysics, science, religion, and all other absolute systems of their authority. Vattimo then became notorious both for his renewed commitment to the core values of Christianity (he was trained as a Catholic intellectual) and for the Vatican's denunciation of his views. Paterlini weaves his interviews with Vattimo into an utterly candid first-person portrait, creating a riveting text that is destined to become one of the most compelling accounts of homosexuality, history, politics, and philosophical invention in the twentieth century.",023114721X,9780231147217,179,Gianni Vattimo,William McCuaig,Piergiorgio Paterlini,4.00,14,0,Columbia University Press,September 17th 2010,Paperback,English,1161-8992416-not-being-god.html

182,The Crafty Cockney: Eric Bristow: The Autobiography,"Eric Bristow is considered to be the greatest darts player of all time and one who pioneered the game’s move from the pub on to the TV screen. He was an unmistakable figure on the oche during his 1980s heyday, with his trademark blonde highlights and red Crafty Cockney t-shirt, and became renowned not just for the number of world titles he won but for his arrogance on stage and off it. His autobiography is a candid account of his rise to the top and reveals his humble beginnings in London’s East End, where gangs like the Richardsons ruled the streets through a mix of fear and torture. Eric would often walk home at night with a claw hammer stuffed down his pants for protection. Cat burglar, shoplifter, thug: Bristow was all of these during his early street-fighting years, but it was darts that proved to be his salvation, introducing him to a new world of beer, babes, and undreamed of success. He won his first world title in 1980 and dominated the scene for the next decade, winning four more. In his rapid rise to the top he gives fascinating insights into the characters that pioneered darts in those early days and helped establish it as a major TV spectacle. Players like Jocky Wilson, a hard-drinking Scot who now lives his life penniless and as a recluse; John Lowe, the stone-faced Englishman who was Bristow’s main rival; Cliff Lazarenko, who Bristow once tried to match drink for drink and ended up with alcohol poisoning; and Keith Deller, the young upstart who caused the biggest upset in darts when, unseeded, he beat Bristow in the 1983 Embassy World Final. When Bristow’s career finally began to slide at the end of the decade he trained his protégé Phil ""The Power"" Taylor, turning him into the most successful player darts has ever known. Bristow holds nothing back as he reveals his battle with dartitis, a psychological condition which left him unable to let go of the dart and almost destroyed his career; his relationship with girlfriend and former women’s world darts champion Maureen Flowers; and his occasional all-to-public falls from grace.",1846055520,9781846055522,344,Eric Bristow, , ,3.61,23,0,Random House UK,December 1st 2008,Hardcover,English,1165-7412082-the-crafty-cockney.html

186,"The Essential Tawfiq al-Hakim: Plays, Fiction, Autobiography","The importance of Tawfiq al-Hakim (1898 to 1989) to the emergence of a modern Arabic literature is second only to that of Naguib Mahfouz. If the latter put the novel among the genres of writing that are now an accepted part of literary production in the Arab world today, Tawfiq al-Hakim is recognized as the undisputed creator of a literature of the theater. In this volume, Tawfiq al-Hakim's fame as a playwright is given prominence. Of the more than seventy plays he wrote, The Sultan's Dilemma, dealing with a historical subject in an appealingly light-hearted manner, is perhaps the best known; it appears in the extended edition of Norton's World Masterpieces and was broadcast on the old Home Service of the BBC. The other full-length play included here, The Tree Climber, is one that reveals al-Hakim's openness to outside influences in this case, the absurdist mode of writing. Of the two one-act plays in this collection, The Donkey Market shows his deftness at turning a traditional folk tale into a hilarious stage comedy. Tawfiq al-Hakim produced several of the earliest examples of the novel in Arabic; included in this volume is an extract from his best known work in that genre, the delightful Diary of a Country Prosecutor, in which he draws on his own experience as a public prosecutor in the Egyptian countryside. Three of the many short stories he published are also included, as well as an extract from The Prison of Life, an autobiography in which Tawfiq al-Hakim writes with commendable frankness about himself. Contents: Introduction by Denys Johnson-Davies, The Sultan's Dilemma (full-length play), The Tree Climber (full-length play), The Donkey Market (one-act play), The Song of Death (one-act play), Diary of a Country Prosecutor (extract from the novel), Miracles for Sale (short story), The Prison of Life (extract from the autobiography), Azrael the Barber (short story), Satan Triumphs (short story).",9774161513,9789774161513,233,توفيق الحكيم,Denys Johnson-Davies,توفيق الحكيم,3.82,11,1,American University in Cairo Press,June 1st 2008,Hardcover,English,1169-3587114-the-essential-tawfiq-al-hakim.html
187,Autobiography,"Born in Berlin in 1920 to a wealthy Jewish family Helmut Newton was an overprotected child with no interest in school. At the age of twelve he purchased his first camera, beginning a fascination with photography that would eventually propel him to the heights of international celebrity. Barely eighteen when Kristallnacht tore Germany apart, Newton managed to escape the Nazis. However, he never made it as far as his intended destination of China. After indulging in a series of shipboard romances, Newton arrived in Singapore and soon became a gigolo and lover of an older woman. But the world was at war, and talk of interning German Jews became prevalent even on the secrets of Singapore. So Newton decamped once more, ending up in Australia, where he joined the Australian army and served as a private for five years. Subsequently, he opened his first ""tiny"" photography studio in Melbourne and in 1948 he married his wife, June, a successful actress. In the 1950s Newton moved to Paris, where he continued to astonish clients with his beautiful and provocatively erotic images of women. His controversial White Women, published in 1976, earned him the titles of King of Kink and Prince of Porn.

188,Whatever Happened to Baby Peggy?: The Autobiography of Hollywood's Pioneer Child Star,"Long before Shirley Temple's curls bounced their way into America's heart, Baby Peggy lit up marquee from coast to coast. She was the original child star produced by Hollywood and her amazing journey set the pattern for all those who followed. Discovered when she was only nineteen months old, Baby Peggy with her angelic face and expert mugging for the camera entertained audiences across the nation and around the world. She starred in a series of short two-reel comedies, completing 150 of them by the time she turned three. By her fifth birthday, Baby Peggy's films were earning as much as Charlie Chaplin's, and she herself was a millionaire, having signed a three-film $3.5 million contract. Establishing a disgraceful tradition for the parents of child performers, Baby Peggy's mother and father, emotional children themselves, squandered her fortune. In What Ever Happened to Baby Peggy?

190,How to Talk Dirty and Influence People: An Autobiography,"In 1963, before the law and his drug habit brought the curtain down on the comedian, Hugh Hefner asked then-superstar Lenny Bruce to write his autobiography. Lenny hired writer Paul Krassner to help him edit the book, which appeared in Playboy over the next two years. Though it's uneven, and somewhat dated, How to Talk Dirty and Influence People deserves a look, if only to balance the movie Lenny , which many of the comedian's friends say missed the man entirely. The book is, simply, Lenny Bruce riffing on his life--from a drab childhood in Brooklyn, to stints in the navy and merchant marine, and finally to the nightclub circuit and eventual stardom. Of course, the veracity of any single anecdote is highly questionable, but How to Talk Dirty and Influence People rises above that, revealed as a fascinating expression of how this comedy icon wanted to be seen. Namely, as a rough-and-tumble kid from the streets, as a hustler and ladies' man, and, finally, as a fearless detonator of society's hypocrisy. (Notice that addict and dissolute don't make the list.) In the movies ... Everett Sloane was a tycoon. He would get his gun off disillusioning Joel McCrea, who wanted to publish a newspaper that would make a statement, and telling him: ""M'boy, you'll see when you get old that it's all a game."" And I used to think, ""No, it's not that way, this cynical old bastard is bullshitting, there are the Good Guys and the Bad Guys, the liars and the truth-tellers."" But Everett Sloane was right. There is only what is. The what-should-be never did exist, but people keep trying to live up to it. There is only what is. How to Talk Dirty and Influence People doesn't catch Bruce's charisma and vaguely sinister electricity--no book could--but it is an interesting, lively read. Bruce was one of the first performers to usher in the new, more honest, more permissive, and more indulgent brand of American art. For anyone who wants to understand our comedy and culture, How to Talk Dirty and Influence People is well worth reading. --Michael Gerber",, ,188,Lenny Bruce, , ,4.02,1254,104,HMH Publishing,1965,Hardcover,English,1172-9551173-how-to-talk-dirty-and-influence-people.html

For the first time, Haiti, with its land and people ravaged by human corruption, looks toward the future with hope. September 30,1991: a military junta ousts Aristide from office, bringing his brief rule to an end. As spokesperson of a rapidly burgeoning grassroots movement, he had refused to compromise, calling for a ""clean slate,"" a new beginning for Haiti. The New York Times has called him the ""Pied-Piper-like leader of Haiti's liberation theology movement."" No public figure in recent history has been the embodiment of so much hope, and so much political drama. In this riveting memoir, Aristide recounts the story of his life, from his early education at the home of his grandfather through his formal training as priest, scripture scholar, and psychologist. His goals, first as priest and then as president: that all Haitians be treated justly as God's people, that all have food and shelter, and that all take pride in their own Creole language and culture.

But as he reveals in this searching autobiography, off the court he was often unhappy and confused, unfulfilled by his great achievements in a sport he had come to resent.

By age 18, Martino moved to Harlem, where he quickly earned a reputation as a hard-bopping six-stringer with formidable chops through a series of apprenticeships with the likes of honking tenor saxophonist Willis ""Gaitor Tail"" Jackson and Hammond B-3 organ master Jack McDuff. Martino made his auspicious debut as a leader at age 22 with 1967's El Hombre on Prestige and followed with a string of potent recordings for the label that further established him as one of the most distinctive guitar voices on the jazz scene. Then, at the peak of his powers, the bottom fell out. In 1980, he underwent surgery as the result of a nearly fatal brain aneurysm. The surgery left him without any memory of the guitar or his musical career. From that point, Martino undertook the long process of recovery, eventually learning how to play the guitar again; but more important, learning to transcend the instrument itself and live his life completely in the moment.

By age 18, Martino moved to Harlem, where he quickly earned a reputation as a hard-bopping six-stringer with formidable chops through a series of apprenticeships with the likes of honking tenor saxophonist Willis ""Gaitor Tail"" Jackson and Hammond B-3 organ master Jack McDuff. Martino made his auspicious debut as a leader at age 22 with 1967's El Hombre on Prestige and followed with a string of potent recordings for the label that further established him as one of the most distinctive guitar voices on the jazz scene. Then, at the peak of his powers, the bottom fell out. In 1980, he underwent surgery as the result of a nearly fatal brain aneurysm. The surgery left him without any memory of the guitar or his musical career. From that point, Martino undertook the long process of recovery, eventually learning how to play the guitar again; but more important, learning to transcend the instrument itself and live his life completely in the moment. More than just the remarkable story of one of the most original and profoundly influential guitarists in jazz history, this extraordinarily revealing autobiography is also a survival manual, of sorts, in overcoming incredible adversity and learning to live in the here and now.",1617130273,9781617130274,192,Pat Martino,Bill Milkowski, ,4.08,24,3,Backbeat Books,September 1st 2011,Hardcover,English,1181-12529503-here-and-now.html

202,African Rhythms: The Autobiography of Randy Weston (a John Hope Franklin Center Book),"The pianist, composer, and bandleader Randy Weston is one of the world’s most influential jazz musicians and a remarkable storyteller whose career has spanned five continents and more than six decades. Packed with fascinating anecdotes, African Rhythms is Weston’s life story, as told by him to the music journalist Willard Jenkins. It encompasses Weston’s childhood in Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood—where his parents and other members of their generation imbued him with pride in his African heritage—and his introduction to jazz and early years as a musician in the artistic ferment of mid-twentieth-century New York. His music has taken him around the world: he has performed in eighteen African countries, in Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, in the Canterbury Cathedral, and at the grand opening of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina: The New Library of Alexandria. Africa is at the core of Weston’s music and spirituality. He has traversed the continent on a continuous quest to learn about its musical traditions, produced its first major jazz festival, and lived for years in Morocco, where he opened a popular jazz club, the African Rhythms Club, in Tangier.Weston’s narrative is replete with tales of the people he has met and befriended, and with whom he has worked.

Citing the plots of Invasion of the Body Snatchers , Terminator 2 , and Blade Runner as proof that our sense of inner and outer is tied to rebellion and slavery, the novel appears at first to be a detail of these films all at once, like a colonization of them from the inside. But almost immediately the plot assumes its own life.

215,Soft Weapons: Autobiography in Transit,"Azar Nafisi’s Reading Lolita in Tehran , Marjane Satrapi’s comics, and “Baghdad Blogger” Salam Pax’s Internet diary are just a few examples of the new face of autobiography in an age of migration, globalization, and terror. But while autobiography and other genres of life writing can help us attend to people whose experiences are frequently unseen and unheard, life narratives can also be easily co-opted into propaganda. In Soft Weapons , Gillian Whitlock explores the dynamism and ubiquity of contemporary life writing about the Middle East and shows how these works have been packaged, promoted, and enlisted in Western controversies. Considering recent autoethnographies of Afghan women, refugee testimony from Middle Eastern war zones, Jean Sasson’s bestsellers about the lives of Arab women, Norma Khouri’s fraudulent memoir Honor Lost, personal accounts by journalists reporting the war in Iraq, Satrapi’s Persepolis , Nafisi’s book, and Pax’s blog, Whitlock explores the contradictions and ambiguities in the rapid commodification of life memoirs. Drawing from the fields of literary and cultural studies, Soft Weapons will be essential reading for scholars of life writing and those interested in the exchange of literary culture between Islam and the West.",0226895262,9780226895260,216,Gillian Whitlock, , ,3.92,12,0,University Of Chicago Press,December 30th 2006,Paperback,English,1195-862655.Soft_Weapons.html

219,The Time of My Life: An Autobiography,"""Some Pow'r did us the giftie grant/ To see oursels as others can't."" With that play on Burns' famous line as a preface, Willard Van Orman Quine sets out to spin the yarn of his life so far. And it is a gift indeed to see one of the world's most famous philosophers as no one else has seen him before. To catch an intimate glimpse of his seminal and controversial theories of philosophy, logic, and language as they evolved, and to hear his warm and often amusing comments on famous contemporary philosophers.From his beginnings in Akron, Ohio in the early 1900s, Quine takes us on a tour of over 100 countries over three-quarters of a century, including close observations of the Depression and two world wars. Far from a philosophical tract, it is an ebullient, folksy account of a richly varied and rounded life. When he does dip into philosophy, it is generally of the armchair sort, and laced with a gentle good humor: ""There is that which one wants to do for the glory of having done it, and there is that which one wants to do for the joy of doing it. One can want to be a scientist because he wants to see himself as a Darwin or an Einstein, and one can want to be a scientist because he is curious about what makes things tick.... In normal cases the two kinds of motivation are in time brought to terms.... In me the glory motive lingered......In this book, Quine approaches the details of his life the way he has always approached them with a sharp sense of interest, adventure and fun. And he has a skill for picking a word that is just off-center enough to pull an ordinary event out of the humdrum of daily life and evoke its personal meaning. The result is a book of memories that is utterly mesmerizing.Willard Van Orman Quine is the author of numerous books, including Word and Object, published by The MIT Press in 1960.A Bradford Book.",0262670046,9780262670043,384,Willard Van Orman Quine, , ,2.88,8,1,Bradford Book,May 12th 2000,Paperback,English,1199-469728.The_Time_of_My_Life.html
220,Long Walk to Freedom: The Autobiography of Nelson Mandela,"Nelson Mandela is one of the great moral and political leaders of our time: an international hero whose lifelong dedication to the fight against racial oppression in South Africa won him the Nobel Peace Prize and the presidency of his country. Since his triumphant release in 1990 from more than a quarter-century of imprisonment, Mandela has been at the center of the most compelling and inspiring political drama in the world. As president of the African National Congress and head of South Africa's anti-apartheid movement, he was instrumental in moving the nation toward multiracial government and majority rule. He is revered everywhere as a vital force in the fight for human rights and racial equality. The foster son of a Thembu chief, Mandela was raised in the traditional, tribal culture of his ancestors, but at an early age learned the modern, inescapable reality of what came to be called apartheid, one of the most powerful and effective systems of oppression ever conceived. In classically elegant and engrossing prose, he tells of his early years as an impoverished student and law clerk in Johannesburg, of his slow political awakening, and of his pivotal role in the rebirth of a stagnant ANC and the formation of its Youth League in the 1950s. He describes the struggle to reconcile his political activity with his devotion to his family, the anguished breakup of his first marriage, and the painful separations from his children. He brings vividly to life the escalating political warfare in the fifties between the ANC and the government, culminating in his dramatic escapades as an underground leader and the notorious Rivonia Trial of 1964, at which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Herecounts the surprisingly eventful twenty-seven years in prison and the complex, delicate negotiations that led both to his freedom and to the beginning of the end of apartheid. Finally he provides the ultimate inside account.",0316323543,9780316323543,656,Nelson Mandela, , ,4.29,40653,"2,034",Back Bay Books,October 8th 2013,Paperback,English,120-17992765-long-walk-to-freedom.html

Besides being an insider's account of the rise and fall of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, it is an eyewitness report of the strategies and the conflicts in the crucial battle zones as the fight for racial justice raged across the South.

226,"Truth, Love & a Little Malice: An Autobiography","Read Khushwant Singh's interview done exclusively for Penguin India about his Autobiography...Khushwant Singh has always been worth listening to. In a career spanning over five decades as writer, journalist and editor, his views have been provocative and controversial, but they have also been profound, deeply perceptive and always compelling. Above all, despite his eminence and popularity, Khushwant Singh has never been less than honest and, most importantly, has never talked down to his readers. His autobiography is of a piece with his life and work. Born in 1915 in pre-Partition Punjab, Khushwant Singh has been witness to most of the major events in modern Indian history--from Independence and Partition to the Emergency and Operation Blue Star--and has known many of the figures who have shaped it. He writes of leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, the terrorist Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the talented and scandalous painter Amrita Shergil, and everyday people who became butchers during Partition, with the clarity and candour expected of him. Writing of his own life, too, Khushwant Singh remains unflinchingly forthright. writer and Member of Parliament; the comforts and disappointments in his marriage of over sixty years; his first, awkward sexual encounter; his phobia of ghosts and his fascination with death; the friends who betrayed him, and also those whom he failed. Uncompromising, comic, often moving and always hugely readable, Truth, Love and a Little Malice is a memoir worthy of one of the great icons of our time. The author, Khushwant Singh, was born in 1915 in Hadali, Punjab. He was educated at Government College, Lahore and at King's College and the Inner Temple in London. He practised at the Lahore High Court for several years before joining the Indian Ministry of External Affairs in 1947. He was sent on diplomatic postings to Canada and London and later went to Paris with UNESCO. He began a distinguished career as a journalist with All India Radio in 1951. Since then he has been founder-editor of Yojana, editor of The Illustrated Weekly of India, the National Herald and The Hindustan Times. Today he is India's best-known columnist and journalist. Among his published works are the classic two-volume A History of the Sikhs, several works of fiction--including the novels Train to Pakistan (winner of the Grove Press Award for the best work of fiction in 1954), I Shall Not Hear the Nightingale, Delhi and The Company of Women--and a number of translated works and non-fiction books on Delhi, nature and current affairs. Khushwant Singh was a Member of Parliament from 1980 to 1986. Among other honours, he was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1974 by the President of India (he returned the decoration in 1984 in protest against the Union Government's siege of the Golden Temple, Amritsar).",0670049166,9780670049165,423,Khushwant Singh, , ,3.90,830,55,Viking Books,February 4th 2002,Hardcover,English,1205-981113.Truth_Love_a_Little_Malice.html
227,Growing Up Untouchable in India: A Dalit Autobiography (Asian Voices),"There is much in Vasant Moon's story of his vasti, his childhood neighborhood in India, that would probably be true of any ghetto anywhere in the world. There is hunger and deprivation, to be sure, but also a sense of community, an easy acceptance of petty crime and violence, the saving grace of sports and organized activities led by caring adults, the off-again on-again aid from relatives, the inexplicable cruelty and unexpected generosity, and escape through education. But there is much here that is peculiarly and vividly Indian as well. Primary among these is the factor of caste, a hierarchical system unrelated to race but based on ancient principles of hereditary pollution and purity, with Brahmans the purest and Untouchables the most polluted. Second is the presence of a hero so important he is described as a ""wave,"" and surely no despised group has ever had a leader as meaningful as Dr. B. R. (Babasaheb) Ambedkar was and remains for India's awakened and ambitious Dalits. Third is nature, with Moon's compelling descriptions of Nagpur's heat and the vivid joy brought by the monsoon. Indeed, every tree, every fruit, every nook and cranny of the world in and around the vasti plays an important part in his story. Dalit literature, poetry, plays, and autobiographies have been one of the most important developments in the culture of India in the past thirty years, yet little has been translated for a Western audience. Vasant Moon's Growing Up Untouchable, the first Dalit autobiography to be published in English, is a moving and eloquent testament to a uniquely Indian life as well as to the universal human spirit.",0742508803,9780742508804,224,Vasant Moon,Gail Omvedt,Eleanor Zelliot,3.25,8,3,Rowman & Littlefield Publishers,December 20th 2000,Hardcover,English,1206-168.Growing_Up_Untouchable_in_India.html

232,The Outsider: My Autobiography,"Jimmy Connors took the tennis world by storm like no player in the history of the game. A shaggy-haired working-class kid from the wrong side of the tracks, he was prepared to battle for every point, to shout and scream until he was heard, and he didn't care whom he upset in doing so. He was brash, he was a brat. He was a crowd-pleaser, a revolutionary. And he won more tournaments - an astonishing 109 - than any other man in history, including eight Grand Slam singles titles. Only now is Connors ready to set the record straight on what really happened on and off the court. The rivalry with John McEnroe, that frequently threatened to turn violent. His romance with Chris Evert, which made them the sweethearts of the sport. The escapades with his partner in crime, Ilie Nastase. The deep roots of the fierce determination that made him the best player on the planet. This is no genteel memoir of a pillar of the tennis establishment. Unflinching, hard-hitting, humorous and passionate, this is the story of the one and only Jimmy Connors.",0593069277,9780593069271,416,Jimmy Connors, , ,3.34,760,145,Bantam Press,May 23rd 2013,Hardcover,English,1210-17307363-the-outsider.html

241,Out On A Limb (American Autobiography),"This is a charming autobiography. Louise Baker lost her right leg above the knee as a result of a road accident; she was on her very first bike ride. She grew up in a small town in America and could hardly have had more idyllic childhood, coming to terms with her impairment and disability in a supportive and caring community. The story of her life includes her college education, two marriages, a trip to Paris, frequent contacts with devotees, never classified as such, but treated as individuals, and all described with humour and charity. I am not sure that she could have been so quite so unaware of the turmoil that she seems to have provoked, or about the motivations of the devotees she encountered, because to my cynical eyes, some of the text appears to be incredibly ingenuous, but the the book is a cheerful description of a life altered, but not blighted by the loss of a leg.

242,What Is the What: The Autobiography of Valentino Achak Deng; A Novel,"What is the What is an epic novel about the lives of two boys during the Sudanese civil war. For those who think they know about the so-called Lost Boys of Sudan, this novel will be an eye-opener. And if you think you know the work of Dave Eggers, this is in many ways a complete departure: it's straightforward and unflinching, and yet full of unexpected humor and adventure amid the madness of war. Eggers has been working on the book for four years now, deeply entrenched in the community of Sudanese refugees in the U.S., and in 2003 went to southern Sudan with a refugee named Valentino Achak Deng. During that trip, Deng was reunited with the family he hadn't seen in 17 years. What is the What is a book about the lives of these two boys -- one, at seven, too young to know what's happening to his country; the other, at ten, old enough to fight for the rebel army. Through it all, the two boys persevere through one of the most brutal civil wars the world has ever known, finding themselves in one unbelievable, utterly surreal situation after another. What is the What is thought-provoking, exciting, and repeatedly heartbreaking.

244,The Log Cabin Lady - An Anonymous Autobiography,"The Log Cabin Lady is the autobiography of a woman who leaves behind a simple life as a pioneer to enter the privileged and alien world of the rich. Feeling isolated and out of place, she struggles to learn the rules and etiquette that her in-laws expect her to follow. To make matters worse, her husband is posted to England and the Log Cabin Lady finds herself grappling with the quirks of British manners and royal protocol. And then come the horrors of the Great War and, through the eyes of the Log Cabin Lady, we watch as the world begins to change.

Written in 1922, this anonymous autobiography spans the period from around 1880 (when the author was aged about three) on to 1897 and being presented at court to Queen Victoria in her diamond jubilee year, through to the long years of the Great War and its aftermath. For every copy of the book sold, Dormouse Press will donate 1 to the Marie Curie Cancer Care charity.

246,From the Bottom of the Heap: The Autobiography of Black Panther Robert Hillary King,"In 1970, a jury convicted Robert Hillary King of a crime he did not commit and sentenced him to 35 years in prison. He became a member of the Black Panther Party while in Angola State Penitentiary, successfully organizing prisoners to improve conditions. In return, prison authorities beat him, starved him, and gave him life without parole after framing him for a second crime. He was thrown into solitary confinement, where he remained in a six by nine foot cell for 29 years as one of the Angola 3. In 2001, the state grudgingly acknowledged his innocence and set him free. This is his story. It begins at the beginning: born black, born poor, born in Louisiana in1942, King journeyed to Chicago as a hobo at the age of 15. He married and had a child, and briefly pursued a semi-pro boxing career to help provide for his family. Just a teenager when he entered the Louisiana penal system for the first time, King tells of his attempts to break out of this system, and his persistent pursuit of justice where there is none. Yet this remains a story of inspiration and courage, and the triumph of the human spirit. The conditions in Angola almost defy description, yet King never gave up his humanity, or the work towards justice for all prisoners that he continues to do today. From the Bottom of the Heap, so simply and humbly told, strips bare the economic and social injustices inherent in our society, while continuing to be a powerful literary testimony to our own strength and capacity to overcome.",1604860391,9781604860399,224,Robert Hillary King,Terry A.

251,The Autobiography of a Fisherman,"With the recent selection of Frank Parker Day's 1928 novel ""Rockbound"" as CBC's 2005 .Canada Reads. winner, interest in the life and work of Day has never been greater. In 1927, Day wrote his autobiographical reflections on fishing, family, and, more broadly, humanity's place in the natural world. ""The Autobiography of a Fisherman"" is a wonderful recollection of one man's life, with characters struggling in a depressed economy, contending with the social pressures of local village life, and responding in one way or the other to the pull of the big city. Day details his early introduction to fishing, which becomes a life-long passion, at once a 'gentle art' and a 'disease'. Studying at Oxford University on a Rhodes Scholarship ('it was easier to get one in those days'), his fervour for fishing is shared by many, but while at the University of Berlin studying ""Beowulf,"" he laments that he 'did no trout fishing.' Eventually, Day returns to Canada and is hired as an English professor at the University of New Brunswick, knowing it to be 'the centre of a well-watered district.' The reader sees him through his final episode of fishing with his father before his father dies, as well as the First World War, during which time he 'never wet a line', and beyond, as he marries, builds a family, and continues to fish. Day's reflections suggest the restorative powers of the environment and should appeal to even those readers who have never thought to sit quietly by the side of a stream, line in hand, waiting.",0802093930,9780802093936,200,Frank Parker Day, , ,4.40,5,1,University of Toronto Press,May 17th 2005,Paperback,English,1228-566108.The_Autobiography_of_a_Fisherman.html

253,In My Own Way: An Autobiography,"In this new edition of his acclaimed autobiography — long out of print and rare until now — Alan Watts tracks his spiritual and philosophical evolution from a child of religious conservatives in rural England to a freewheeling spiritual teacher who challenged Westerners to defy convention and think for themselves. From early in this intellectual life, Watts shows himself to be a philosophical renegade and wide-ranging autodidact who came to Buddhism through the teachings of Christmas Humphreys and D. T. Suzuki. Told in a nonlinear style, In My Own Way wonderfully combines Watts’ own brand of unconventional philosophy and often hilarious accounts of gurus, celebrities, psychedelic drug experiences, and wry observations of Western culture. A charming foreword written by Watts’ father sets the tone of this warm, funny, and beautifully written story of a compelling figure who encouraged readers to “follow your own weird” — something he always did himself, as his remarkable account of his life shows.",1577315847,9781577315841,384,Alan W.

Brenda Rees hated being 'awkward', and hated even more her female role and body. No one seemed to understand that 'she' was really a 'he'. Young Brenda saw no hope of relieving this conflict; her apparently unique condition condemned her to isolation, verbal abuse and misunderstanding. She spent five useless months in a psychiatric hospital. But at the age of twenty-seven, Brenda discovered the existence of transsexualism. She was not alone, and it appeared that help was at hand.

271,Raging Bull: My Autobiography,"From a pint and a pie to ice baths and deep tissue massages, from Cornish Colts to World Cup final captain, and from qualified cattle inseminator to owner of a sports fashion label, Phil Vickery, a.k.a. “Raging Bull,” has pretty such seen and done it all in life and in rugby, straddling the amateur and professional eras like a bovine colossus. This is the iconic tight-head prop's own incredible story, the tale of a true legend of rugby union; a tough, no-nonsense player who is as fearless and uncompromising on the pitch as he is a great raconteur off of it. His career spans amateurism and professionalism, starting in the Cornish countryside and traveling to two World Cup finals and two Lions tours. Vickery is a hugely passionate player. He sports a tattoo which announces “I'll fight you to the death” and has overcome serious injuries (including eight operations) in a career of stunning highs and devastating lows. He plays his sport in the best traditions of rugby and he is a storyteller par excellence. Raging Bull will transport readers to the England front row in Six Nations clashes at Twickenham, to the changing rooms on British Lions tours, and to the bars of many an amateur rugby club. It will remind fans what rugby is really all about—the fun and camaraderie, the passion and commitment, as the former herdsman turned England and Lions star takes you to the heart and soul of the sport he loves.",0007354215,9780007354214,352,Phil Vickery,Alison Kervin, ,3.27,15,0,HarperCollins UK,November 1st 2010,Hardcover,Swedish,1246-8707996-raging-bull.html

277,"Smokin' Joe: The Autobiography of a Heavyweight Champion of the World, Smokin' Joe Frazier","When boxing was bold, bright and glamorous and the fights were the hottest sporting events of the year, Joe Frazier was king as the Heavyweight Champion of the World. From 1970 to 1973 he reigned, and with his career record of 32-4-1 with 27 knockouts and an Olympic gold medal, Frazier leaves little question that he is one of the greatest fighters of all time.Well-known, loved and revered as a gentleman and a fierce competitor in the ring, Joe Frazier at last speaks his mind in Smokin' Joe -- about growing up poor to fighting in the first $2.5 million bout; about the early days of his friendship with Muhammad Ali and how their relationship changed; and about the often corrupt world of boxing and what really went on inside and outside the ring. Packed with stories that no one outside his family knows (such as the reason he was not drafted for Vietnam, his role in Ali's reinstatement, his biggest fear), Smokin' Joe will finally answer all the questions his fans have been wondering about -- his thoughts on George Foreman, Don King and Mike Tyson (among others), his training regimen and fight strategies, and much, much more -- thereby telling the tale of what it takes to be a champion and a legend. His good-hearted nature and uncanny ability to make you laugh come through as he weaves this story in his colorful style that is personable, funny and a real delight. The perfect gift for Father's Day, and published to celebrate the 25th anniversary of ""The Fight of the Century"", Smokin' Joe will entertain and enthrall readers with the account of one of America's strongest treasures.",002860847X,9780028608471,213,Joe Frazier,Phil Berger, ,3.92,49,4,MacMillan Publishing Company,March 15th 1996,Hardcover,English,1251-514374.Smokin_Joe.html

She captured those journeys in two dozen excellent volumes of biography and travel. TRAVELLER'S PRELUDE is the story of her early life.

She did in fact enter the University of London, but WW II intervened, and she became a nurse on the Italian front. Her travels in the Mideast followed these adventures.

For nearly half a century—first as assistant secretary, also succeeding W. E. B. Dubois as editor of The Crisis , and finally succeeding Walter White as executive director—Roy Wilkins served and led the N.A.A.C.P. in their fight for justice for African Americans. Wilkins was a relentless pragmatist who advocated progressive change through legal action. He participated or led in the achievement of every major civil rights advance, working for the integration of the army, helping to plan and organize the historic march on Washington, and pushing every president from Franklin Roosevelt to Jimmy Carter to implement civil rights legislation.

286,American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History,"He is the deadliest American sniper ever, called “the devil” by the enemies he hunted and “the legend” by his Navy SEAL brothers . .. From 1999 to 2009, U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle recorded the most career sniper kills in United States military history. The Pentagon has officially confirmed more than 150 of Kyles kills (the previous American record was 109), but it has declined to verify the astonishing total number for this book. Iraqi insurgents feared Kyle so much they named him al-Shaitan (“the devil”) and placed a bounty on his head. Kyle earned legendary status among his fellow SEALs, Marines, and U.S. Army soldiers, whom he protected with deadly accuracy from rooftops and stealth positions. Gripping and unforgettable, Kyle’s masterful account of his extraordinary battlefield experiences ranks as one of the great war memoirs of all time. A native Texan who learned to shoot on childhood hunting trips with his father, Kyle was a champion saddle-bronc rider prior to joining the Navy. After 9/11, he was thrust onto the front lines of the War on Terror, and soon found his calling as a world-class sniper who performed best under fire. He recorded a personal-record 2,100-yard kill shot outside Baghdad; in Fallujah, Kyle braved heavy fire to rescue a group of Marines trapped on a street; in Ramadi, he stared down insurgents with his pistol in close combat. Kyle talks honestly about the pain of war—of twice being shot and experiencing the tragic deaths of two close friends. American Sniper also honors Kyles fellow warriors, who raised hell on and off the battlefield. And in moving first-person accounts throughout, Kyles wife, Taya, speaks openly about the strains of war on their marriage and children, as well as on Chris. Adrenaline-charged and deeply personal, American Sniper is a thrilling eyewitness account of war that only one man could tell.",0062082353,9780062082350,381,Chris Kyle,Scott McEwen,Jim DeFelice,3.96,57972,"5,150",William Morrow,January 3rd 2012,Hardcover,English,126-11887018-american-sniper.html

At last Crashing Thunder agreed to tell Radin his life story, one that Radin calls ""a true rake's progress."" Speaking through Radin, Crashing Thunder told of his childhood, stories of Winnebago gods, his appetite for women and beer, and his extraordinary friends and relatives, including his brother-in-law, Thunder Cloud, then in his third incarnation. Crashing Thunder also told of his redemption through his new religion, peyote. To enhance understanding of the autobiography and its place in anthropology and literature, a new foreword, appendix, and index have been prepared by eminent Native American scholar, Arnold Krupat. Paul Radin (1883-1959) was an American anthropologist who was considered an authority on the culture of primitive societies, especially the tribal societies of native North Americans. Among his many works are the books The Winnebago Tribe, The Road of Life and Death: A Ritual Drama of the American Indians , and The Trickster: A Study in American Indian Mythology .

First published in 2014 and now available in paperback, it was critically lauded and declared the definitive life of this great artist and writer. Drawing on letters, diaries and unpublished material, including Brecht's medical records, Parker offers a rich and enthralling account of Brecht's life and work, viewed through the prism of the artist. Tracing his extraordinary life, from his formative years in Augsburg, through the First World War, his politicisation during the Weimar Republic and his years of exile, up to the Berliner Ensemble's dazzling productions in Paris and London, Parker shows how Brecht achieved his transformative effect upon world theatre and poetry.

In prison more than half of his life for assaults and armed robberies, Smith became confined in a peculiar kind of hell from which his only route of escape was to master the art of writing. His book shows us a face of crime not often encountered in run-of-the-mill true-crime books: a face as tender and intimate as a lover's, yet as frightening as a killer's. Powerfully written from beginning to end, this is an extraordinarily vivid account of how a kid from South London became a career criminal, a blistering indictment of a system that brutalized young offenders, and an unsentimental acknowledgment of the adrenaline-fueled thrills of the criminal life. Shocking, fascinating, and horrifying, it also reveals Smith as one of the most talented writers of his generation.",0141015799,9780141015798,482,Razor Smith, , ,3.83,60,13,Penguin Books,July 28th 2005,Paperback,English,1265-419178.Few_Kind_Words_and_a_Loaded_Gun.html

What it is, is a piece of insanity. From the perspective of a hospital bed, through a drug-induced haze, Wellman's memory makes connections between events in life that his rational mind would never perceive...between a child's first hunting trip and a drunken weekend with Spencer Tracy, between working with Clark Gable and a recalcitrant St. Bernard in 'Call of the Wild' and working with Ernie Pyle and real fighting troops in 'GI Joe,' and between the friendship and courage and sorrow of flying in the Lafayette Escadrille and everything that ever happened in the rest of his life. What it is, is a beautiful insight into the mind of a man who would have been called a genius if there'd been anybody willing to risk a black eye by calling him that. What it is, is a good and moving and funny and warm and honest...and a little crazy. Exactly like William Wellman. In the halcyon days of Hollywood, Bill Wellman was known as a difficult man to get to know...hard and tough and more than a little fearsome. Still just as tough and no easier to know, 'A Short Time for Insanity,' at least makes him an easy man to love.",0801568048,9780801568046,276,WILLIAM A.

297,"May I Have Your Attention, Please?: The Autobiography","The warm, hilarious story of the Gavin and Stacey cocreator and star As far back as he can remember James Corden has only ever wanted to be in one place: in front of an audience, doing something to make them cry, shout, scream, or giggle uncontrollably—but it wasn't that easy getting there. Growing up, his dad would drive him up and down to London for auditions, sometimes three or four times a week, only to be met with constant rejections. Even the teenage distractions of girls, forming his own pop group, attempted (and failed) shoplifting, or the endless detentions he'd get from exasperated teachers didn't put him off. He knew where he wanted to be and he'd keep on trying until he got there, and here is the story of how he did it. From his time as one of the founding players of his school's first ever rugby team to nationwide fame as the loveably loud Smithy in the award-winning Gavin and Stacey , this is a tenderly—and very funnily—told story of what it’s like to try, try, and try again and get there in the end.",1846059356,9781846059353,344,James Corden, , ,3.81,1338,123,Random House UK,December 1st 2011,Hardcover,English,127-12706383-may-i-have-your-attention-please.html
298,More Ronnie O'Sullivan: The Autobiography,"Since 2003, the ups and downs of Ronnie O'Sullivan's life have continued to be as vertiginous as prior to the publication of Ronnie. On the one hand he has been as successful at the table as ever, winning everything from the Welsh Open and the Masters twice apiece, to the Embassy World Championship. There's not a major tournament in world snooker that Ronnie hasn't won at least once. On the other hand, Ronnie continues to be dogged by inconsistency, considers this to be at the root of his being a ""complete failure,"" and has continued to battle with his depression. Having a stable family set-up and Ray Reardon as a mentor have helped enormously, but there have still been times—walking out of the UK Championships in 2006 mid-match against Stephen Hendry—when the demons have prevailed. In More Ronnie O'Sullivan , he unravels some of the contradictions that seem to rule his life, and comes to grips with the coping with the pressures at the very top. It's more of an indepth look at what makes O'Sullivan tick that gets to the bottom of everything—snooker, drugs, alcohol, family life, playing for Arsenal celebs XI—rather than the canter through his ascent and problems with his father that formed the basis of his first autobiography.",, ,288,Ronnie O'Sullivan, , ,4.80,5,0,Orion Publishing,December 1st 2013,Hardcover,English,1270-2463792.More_Ronnie_O_Sullivan.html

302,"Autobiography of a Generation: Italy, 1968","1968 is symbolic in Italy of a whole decade of struggles by students, women, workers, intellectuals, and technicians. This extraordinary book, first published in Italy in 1988 as Autoritratto di gruppo, documents the intricate web of individual and communal experiences in the political movements of the 60s. Luisa Passerini, internationally known for her work in memory, oral history, and their intersections with social movements, sets out to rescue the ""forgotten memory"" of her generation and to give it literary status. Framed and illuminated by sessions of psychoanalysis, this absorbing narrative weaves episodes of Passerini's autobiography-including her involvement in the 1968 uprisings-oral histories of other participants, and Passerini's sociological observations. ""Passerini's book captures something that is, arguably, closer to lived history than anything we are accustomed to reading,"" writes Joan Wallach Scott in her foreword. It raises critical questions about how we reconstruct the past and vividly illustrates the forces that shaped a generation. As Passerini movingly shows, there was in those rebellions something that went further than rancor and taking sides: the idea of a new world and new human relationships.

It was his original intention to permit no publication of his memoirs until after his death; but, after leaving ""Pier No. 70,"" he concluded that a considerable portion might now suitably be given to the public. It is that portion, garnered from the quarter-million of words already written, which will appear in this Review during the coming year.

305,Katz's: Autobiography of a Delicatessen,"This first-ever book on Katz’s captures the delicatessen’s unique appeal that continues to attract food lovers from around the world. Located on the corner of Ludlow and E. Houston in New York City, Katz’s Deli is a destination for thousands of tourists and for the many regulars who have kept the tradition of Friday evening hot dogs going strong for 125 years. Established in 1888, Katz’s has carried on the tradition of Jewish deli food long after the refrigerator made pickled meats an aesthetic choice instead of a necessity. A great visual record of how a restaurant runs, this hefty volume showcases hundreds of color photographs by Baldomero Fernandez that document the unique character of this New York institution. Included are the people on both sides of the counter—cutters and customers—the pastrami stations, photo-covered walls, the too-small kitchen. Adam Richman's nostalgic and evocative foreword perfectly sets the stage for the book. Another invaluable complement to the photos is the text written by co-owner Jake Dell. Jake outlines the deli's long history, defines the difference between pastrami and corned beef, and writes about the ""family"" that keeps Katz's operating on a day-to-day basis. This book will prove irresistible to regulars whose grandfather took them for their first pastrami, and also to the uninitiated who have yet to walk on the sawdust-covered terrazzo floor, ticket in hand...for anyone who loves New York history and food, even the vegetarians! Published in association with Glenn Horowitz Bookseller, Inc., this handsome book is not a mere paperback; the high production value of the thick card stock cover and French flaps is reflected in the printing and the Japanese paper, the handy format allowing for easy browsing.",0983863261,9780983863267,384,Jake Dell,Baldomero Fernandez,Adam Richman,4.86,7,1,Bauer and Dean Publishers,May 31st 2014,Paperback,English,1277-18474713-katz-s.html

307,Autobiography: I Wonder as I Wander (The Collected Works of Langston Hughes #14),"I Wonder As I Wander (1956), Hughes's second volume of autobiography, is a continuation from The Big Sea, detailing his global travels to such areas as Cuba, Haiti, Paris, the Soviet Union, and the Far East. It culminates in his 1937 coverage for the Baltimore Afro-American of the Spanish Civil War. The travelogue highlights the beginning of Hughes's career as a journalist, a further realization of his goal to live as a professional writer. Furthermore, it shows the influence of legendary black educator Mary McLeod Bethune, who inspired Hughes to travel through the South giving readings of his poetry. His recollections of American journeys place him as well in Carmel, California, and the San Francisco area, where he was befriended by Noël Sullivan and was among the set of Hollywood personalities sometimes including James Cagney, Greta Garbo, Jean Harlow, as well as Indian mystic J. Krishnamurti. Hughes also shows readers the lighter side of his adventures in the Caribbean, where he experienced the rhythms of Afro-Cuban music and the wonders of such sights as the Citadel in Haiti. In 1932, having traveled with a group of African Americans to the Soviet Union to make a film about southern black steelworkers and domestic laborers, Hughes became familiar not only with Moscow's theatrical life but also with ""colored"" minorities in the new republics of Soviet Central Asia. As a wanderer, he carried with him a record player and a collection of jazz recordings and became an informal participant in ""cultural exchange."" For Hughes, the lack of appreciation of jazz by Russian ideologues was a major flaw in the system. In Tokyo and Shanghai, he learned about Asian global politics and tough street life, and in Paris he reacquainted himself with its nightlife and such personalities as Ada ""Bricktop"" Smith and Josephine Baker. Throughout his journey, he observed the presence of blacks, whether as entertainers in major capitals or as soldiers on the battlefront in Barcelona and Madrid. His coverage of the Spanish Civil War is a serious report of the tragedy of conscripted North African Moors and the heroic efforts of the International Brigades and such African Americans as Milton Herndon in their fight against fascism. Spain is also a window into flamenco musical culture, where singers such as Pastora Pavón offer their own form of the blues. In rare moments, Hughes reveals aspects of his personal romantic encounters. Also of great interest are his recollections of writers Arthur Koestler, Nicolás Guillén, Pablo Neruda, and Ernest Hemingway. I Wonder As I Wander shows how Hughes maintained a Harlem-derived black consciousness, while expanding it through global wandering.",0826214347,9780826214348,448,Langston Hughes,Joseph McLaren, ,4.25,438,38,University of Missouri,February 1st 2003,Hardcover,English,1279-226009.Autobiography.html
308,Commando: The Autobiography of Johnny Ramone,"Raised in Queens, New York, Johnny Ramone founded one of the most influential rock bands of all time, but he never strayed from his blue-collar roots and attitude. He was truly imbued with the angry-young-man spirit that would characterize his persona both on and off stage. Through it all, Johnny kept the band focused and moving forward, ultimately securing their place in music history by inventing punk rock. The Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002—two years later, Johnny died of cancer, having outlived two other founding members. Revealing, inspiring, and told on his own terms, this highly designed memoir also features Johnny’s assessment of the Ramones’ albums; a number of eccentric Top Ten lists; rare historical artifacts; and scores of personal and professional photos, many of which have never before been published. Praise for Commando: “Amazing book . . . dense and throbbing with character—enough to bring this departed New York icon barking back to life.” — New York Daily News ""Johnny's delightful, sadly posthumous autobiography, Commando , is just like its author—as punk as it gets."" — Wall Street Journal “Ramone memoir reveals charming, grumpy punk icon.” —Reuters “There's no grand confessional to end Commando , just a nod of gratitude toward family, friends, and fans.

312,"Intimate Memories, the Autobiography of Mabel Dodge Luhan (Abridged)","Mabel Dodge Luhan--salon hostess, writer, and muse--published four volumes and 1,600 pages of ""intimate memories"" during the 1930s. In vivid and compelling prose, she explored the momentous changes in sexuality, politics, art, and culture that moved Americans from the Victorian into the modern age. Noted for assembling and inspiring some of the leading creative men and women of her day--Gertrude Stein, John Reed, and D. H. Lawrence among them--she was a ""mover and shaker"" of national and international renown during her lifetime (1879-1962). Lois Palken Rudnick, Luhan's biographer, has abridged the original volumes into one book that highlights Luhan's struggles for self-expression and community: from Gilded Age Buffalo, New York; to Florence, Italy; to radical Greenwich Village in New York; and, finally, to Taos, New Mexico, where she met and eventually married her fourth husband, Antonio Luhan, a Taos Pueblo Indian. This new edition of Luhan's edited memoirs (first published in 1999) contains a new foreword as well as the original introduction. Lois Palken Rudnick is Chair of the American Studies Department at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, and the author of numerous books and essays on New Mexico history and culture including ""Mabel Dodge Luhan: New Woman, New Worlds,"" the award-winning ""Utopian Vistas: The Mabel Dodge Luhan House and the American Counterculture,"" and editor of a recent edition of Alice Corbin Henderson's ""Red Earth: Poems of New Mexico.""",086534616X,9780865346161,270,Mabel Dodge Luhan, , ,4.30,10,1,Sunstone Press,December 1st 2007,Paperback,English,1283-3218330-intimate-memories-the-autobiography-of-mabel-dodge-luhan.html

314,Autobiography of a Yogi,"Named one of the Hundred Best Spiritual Books of the Century, this is no ordinary book! It is a spiritual treasure, read by millions of truth-seekers around the world. Only rarely does a sage of Paramhansa Yogananda's stature write a firsthand account of his life experiences. Followers of many religious traditions have come to recognize in Autobiography of a Yogi, a masterpiece of spiritual literature. Yet, for all its depth, it is full of gentle hu- mor, lively stories, and practical common sense. This classic's popularity has increased steadily over the years. This is a verbatim reprinting of the original 1946 edition, with all its inherent power, just as the Great Master of Yoga first presented it. About The Author: Paramhansa Yogananda (often spelled 'Paramahansa' Yogananda) was born on January 5, 1893 in Gorakhpur, India. He was the first yoga master of India to permanently live and teach in the West. Yogananda arrived in America in 1920, and traveled throughout the United States on what he called his 'spiritual campaigns'. His enthusiastic audiences filled the largest halls in America. Hundreds of thousands came to see the yogi from India. At some packed venues thousands were turned away nightly. A national sensation, Yogananda's lectures and books were extensively written about by the major media of the era, including Time Magazine, Newsweek, and Life. He was even invited to the White House by President Calvin Coolidge. Yogananda continued to lecture and write up to his passing in 1952. Yogananda's initial impact was truly impressive. But his lasting impact has been even greater. Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi, first published in 1946, helped launch a spiritual revolution throughout the world. His message was nonsectarian and universal. Yogananda's Guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar, sent him to the West with the admonition, ""The West is high in material attainments, but lacking in spiritual und",8190210505, ,518,Parmahansa Yogananda, , ,4.24,25,1,Penguin Books Ltd,,Paperback,,1285-25386169-autobiography-of-a-yogi.html

318,Rush: The Autobiography,"In 2006, Liverpool fans voted Ian Rush among the top three all-time greatest players in the history of the club. Taking his place alongside Kenny Dalglish and Steven Gerrard, he surpassed football legends such as Fowler, Keegan, Owen, Smith, Carragher and Hansen. Ian Rush is quite simply Liverpool's greatest goalscorer and, along with Jimmy Greaves and Denis Law, one of the finest natural penalty-box predators the game has ever seen. This is the story of a rough-edged Welsh teenager thrust into the ranks of an already great side, who didn't feel up to it, but who learned how to grow as a player and a man until he became the most devastating finisher in English football. Rush's story is bursting with honesty and insight, emotional turmoil and tragedy, and hilarious tales and asides. It is a near-mythical tale of triumph and tragedy. Of an era when Liverpool FC became nigh on invincible, made the League title their own, and rode the highs of European and FA Cup Finals alongside the devastating tragedies of Heysel and Hillsborough. The drama of Rush's time at Liverpool during the 80s - the decade that defined the club more than any other - is thrillingly captured in this autobiography, which takes you into the thick of the action, as well as offering a frank and insightful analysis of football today.",0091928060,9780091928063,432,Ian Rush, , ,3.67,3,0,Ebury Press,May 7th 2009,Paperback,English,1289-13270738-rush.html

A small-town girl who conquers the Big City on her own terms . . . a sucker for happy endings with an attraction to all things fattening—and a personality that oddly gets her in (and out of) trouble at lightning speed. This is her story . . . and perhaps a little of yours, too. True, Vivian Livingston has the gig of a lifetime, starring 24/7 as the heroine of www.Vivianlives.com , a kind of “girls rule” Web site. But it wasn’t always that way. So rewind, back to the traditionally traumatic last semester of college, when Vivian, feeling the need for drastic change, randomly enters a songwriting contest and, to everyone’s surprise, actually wins. The prize—an incredible weekend getaway to the capital of the universe: New York City. One amazing weekend getaway later, without a real “life” plan and weeks away from graduation, she and her best friend Sophie make the obvious decision . . . NYC here we come! But the moment Vivian and Sophie set foot in their new apartment—a raw, hand-me-down, fourth-floor walk-up studio—they know that life in the Big Apple is going to be anything but easy. Lacking both dough and direction, Vivian has a rough time with the transition. Even worse, Sophie seems to have found a soul mate—and has left Vivian behind. But Vivian is determined to make her world work, despite a few challenging bumps in the road. Rather than ship out, things begin to shape up, as Vivian not only gets the (virtual) keys to the city, but most important, discovers the keys to her own heart.

Once or twice a generation, an athlete transcends his sport - at last, here's Seve Ballesteros in his own words There are golfers, and there are golfers. And then there's Seve. Severiano Ballesteros was perhaps the most naturally gifted golfer ever to have walked a fairway. From the moment his brother Manuel gave him his first club he was unstoppable. A few weeks before his seventeenth birthday he turned pro. Five years later he won the Open. A genius had arrived. For the best part of two decades Seve dominated the golfing landscape. He played shots others could only dream of. With 94 wins as a professional (including 5 majors) he was a phenomenon, an athlete who transcended his sport. But Seve stood for more than simple excellence. Almost single-handedly, Seve gave European golf credibility; almost single-handedly, he made the Ryder Cup one of the greatest contests in world sport. And when, as captain, he finally lifted the trophy on home soil in 1997, a whole continent rejoiced. His pride and passion have inspired millions, and we have taken him to our hearts. Here, for the first time, Seve tells his own story. From his humble beginnings right up to the present day, here at last is the man behind the magic in his own words. Seve is utterly entertaining, blazingly charismatic and unique. Severiano ""Seve"" Ballesteros Sota was a Spanish professional golfer and a leading sports figure. He won more than 90 international tournaments in an illustrious career. He first caught the attention of the sporting world in 1976, when at the age of 19 he finished second at The Open. He played a leading role in the re-emergence of European golf, helping the European Ryder Cup team to five wins both as a player and captain. He won the World Match Play Championship a record-tying five times. He is generally regarded as the greatest Continental European golfer of all time and won a record 50 times on the European Tour.

326,Autobiography of an Orgasm,"What do we think we know about the female orgasm? It’s that peak experience, an ultimate moment of climax and release that nevertheless eludes so many. Some women live for it, some have multiple orgasms, some fake it while others simply learn to do without. “Autobiography of an Orgasm” (November, 2014) is a sexy-spiritual memoir that’s part steamy erotica and part straight-talking advice. It’s the result of Betsy Blankenbaker’s tireless journey to learn everything she could about the female orgasm in a personal quest to feel as much as possible after too many years of feeling nothing at all. To solve the mystery of why she spent much of her life disconnected from her sensuality, struggling to overcome the shame of childhood sexual assault, Blankenbaker set out at age 45 to thoroughly research women’s orgasm. Along the way, she spent time in bed with orgasm experts, strolled down New York’s tony Fifth Avenue with a healing jade egg in her vagina, had a spiritual awakening throug orgasm in Africa, and received sacred “Womb Rites” from a shaman in the Peruvian Amazon. Through lively storytelling and a delicious sense of humor, Betsy shares why she was never able to find fulfillment in life, love or sex prior to her pilgrimage to healing and pleasure. Her findings resulted in this unprecedented book, “Autobiography of an Orgasm.” “Autobiography of an Orgasm” seeks to answer the questions women have but don’t know how (or whom) to ask. It is the author’s fervent prayer that it will inspire women everywhere to burn their dysfunctional bridges and step into healing by learning to love their bodies and themselves.",, ,0,Betsy Blankenbaker, , ,4.43,7,2,BookBaby,November 6th 2014,ebook, ,1296-23769642-autobiography-of-an-orgasm.html
327,Anthropology and Autobiography,"Anthropological writings by anthropologists in the field have long been a valuable tool to the profession. But until now, the theoretical implications of its use have not been fully explored. Anthropology and Autobiography provides unique insights into the fieldwork, autobiographical materials and/or textual critiques of anthropologists, many of whose ethnographies are already familiar. It considers the role of the anthropologist as fieldworker and writer, examining the ways in which nationality, age, gender, and personal history influence the anthropologist's behavior towards the individuals he is observing. This volume also contributes to debates about reflexivity and the political responsibility of the anthropologist, who, as a participant, has traditionally made only stylized appearances in the academic text. The contributors examine their work among peoples in Africa, Japan, the Caribbean, Greece, Shetland, England, indigenous Australia, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. Autobiography is developed alongside political, intellectual, and historical changes. The anthropologists confront and examine issues of racism, reciprocity and friendships. Anthropology and Autobiography will appeal to anthropologists and social scientists interested in ethnographic approaches, the self, reflexivity, qualitative methodology, and the production of texts.",0415051894,9780415051897,268,Judith Okely, , ,2.50,4,0,Routledge,July 21st 1992,Paperback,English,1297-1372246.Anthropology_and_Autobiography.html

As a shy young woman, she sought to expand her horizons and fly, like a butterfly. At first, her focus was on worldly success and fame, but when she found herself unable to obtain satisfactory answers to her doubts about religious traditions, she began a spiritual quest for the truth. She emerged from her cocoon with Islam by her side, to guide her in her life and travels. In this autobiographical account, the author uses a series of flashbacks to weave back and forth among important events and places in her life, before and after she embraced Islam. She explains what attracted her to Islam and describes the effects of her choice on key relationships in her life. Her narration is laced with personal anecdotes and heart-felt advice about being patient in the face of adversity. Her experiences are woven together to create more than just a simple narrative; this is a unique account of the Metamorphosis of a Muslim.",, ,144,Lena Winfrey Seder, , ,4.25,12,7,International Islamic Publishing House,2011,Paperback,English,1301-11557912-the-metamorphosis-of-a-muslim.html

As he grows older, his account turns to life in the open: nomadic cattle-raising, farming, trading, communal enterprises, tribal dances and ceremonies, lovemaking, and marriage. As Left Handed grows in understanding and stature, the accumulated wisdom of his people is made known to him. He learns the Navajo life founded upon principles: the necessity of honesty, foresightedness, self-discipline. The style of the narrative is almost biblical in its rhythms; but biblical, too, in many respects, is the traditional way of life it recounts.",0803279582,9780803279582,378,Left Handed,Walter Dyk,Luci Tapahonso,3.73,49,8,Bison Books,March 1st 1967,Paperback,English,1304-131607.Left_Handed_Son_of_Old_Man_Hat.html

337,David Ginola - The Autobiography-H,"Ginola is a man in demand. Everywhere he goes he attracts attention, whether it be mesmerising defenders on the field or parading down the catwalks of Paris and Milan away from football. He's as likely to be seen making the headlines in ""Hello!"" and the tabloid front pages as in the sports columns. But is there more to Ginola, the ""sex symbol""? In his autobiography, he provides an insight into his private life which few outsiders know about. He talks candidly about the women closest to him, his work for the Red Cross and anti-landmines campaign and the pressures of being a huge media star constantly under the spotlight. It wasn't always so good for Ginola. In his early years in France, he describes the traumas of his army national service and how, as a footballer, he went from being the most hated man in France to Footballer of the Year in the same season. He describes in detail his relationship with Eric Cantona and his bust-ups with the authorities, as well as a reviled Gerard Houllier, which led to his controversial exclusion from the 1998 French World Cup squad. On joining a Newcastle team under Kevin Keegan, Ginola was soon given the freedom of the ""Toon"". He writes openly about those exciting days at St James's Park, before the arrival of Kenny Dalglish led to his acrimonious departure to Spurs. Ginola is forthright about his mixed feelings on the arrival of George Graham at White Hart Lane and how their relationship developed, and his future at the club. More recently, his critics have branded Ginola a cheat for diving. Ginola responds honestly to these accusations, as he does to the controversy surrounding his comments to the Oxford Union about Alan Shearer and foreigners in the game.",000710099X,9780007100996,312,David Ginola, , ,3.11,9,0,HarperCollins Publishers,September 1st 2000,Hardcover,English,1306-1433848.David_Ginola_The_Autobiography_H.html

341,Reading Jackie: Her Autobiography in Books,"Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis never wrote a memoir, but she told her life story and revealed herself in intimate ways through the nearly 100 books she brought into print during the last two decades of her life as an editor at Viking and Doubleday. Based on archives and interviews with Jackie's authors, colleagues, and friends, Reading Jackie mines this significant period of her life to reveal both the serious and the mischievous woman underneath the glamorous public image. Though Jackie had a reputation for avoiding publicity, she willingly courted controversy in her books. She was the first editor to commission a commercially-successful book telling the story of Thomas Jefferson’s relationship with his female slave. Her publication of Gelsey Kirkland's attack on dance icon George Balanchine caused another storm. Jackie rarely spoke of her personal life, but many of her books ran parallel to, echoed, and emerged from her own experience. She was the editor behind bestsellers on the assassinations of Tsar Nicholas II and John Lennon, and in another book she paid tribute to the allure of Marilyn Monroe and Maria Callas. Her other projects take us into territory she knew well: journeys to Egypt and India, explorations of the mysteries of female beauty and media exploitation, into the minds of photographers, art historians, and the designers at Tiffany & Co. Many Americans regarded Jackie as the paragon of grace, but few knew her as the woman sitting on her office floor laying out illustrations, or flying to California to persuade Michael Jackson to write his autobiography. Reading Jackie provides a compelling behind-the-scenes look at Jackie at work: how she commissioned books and nurtured authors, as well as how she helped to shape stories that spoke to her strongly. Jackie is remembered today for her marriages to JFK and to Aristotle Onassis, but her real legacy is the books that reveal the tastes, recollections, and passions of an independent woman.",0385530994,9780385530996,368,William Kuhn, , ,3.61,587,128,Nan A.

343,The Autobiography of Mother Jones,"The Autobiography of Mother Jones by Mother Jones, 1925. Labor organizer Mother Jones worked tirelessly for economic justice. Mary Harris ""Mother"" Jones (1837–1930) was an Irish-American schoolteacher and dressmaker who became a prominent labor and community organizer. She then helped coordinate major strikes and cofounded the Industrial Workers of the World. While her opponents called her the “most dangerous woman in America,” fellow organizer Elizabeth Gurley Flynn called Jones “the greatest woman agitator of our times.” Jones combined dynamic speaking skills and radical organizing methods to mobilize thousands of laborers and working-class families. She said of herself, “I’m not a humanitarian, I’m a hell-raiser.” Mary Harris Jones was born approximately August 1, 1837 in Cork, Ireland to Helen Cotter and Richard Harris. She had two brothers and two sisters. Jones later claimed a birthdate of May 1, 1830. Biographers suggest that she chose 1830 to add to the image of white-haired “Mother” Jones, and May first to connect herself to the Haymarket demonstration for the eight-hour day. Mary’s father moved to the United States in the 1840s, and the rest of the family followed soon thereafter.",, ,169,Mary Harris Jones, , ,4.17,6,3,Mother Jones,July 2nd 2014,Kindle Edition,English,1311-23838327-the-autobiography-of-mother-jones.html

345,Jason Leonard: The Autobiography,"The rag-to-riches tale of rugby union's most capped forward of all time - how a brilliant young player overcame a life-threatening injury to make it to the very top of the international game. Jason Leonard's story starts as rugby started - in the amateur days, when the Cockney Carpenter began playing for Barking and Saracens in the days before multi-million pound business owners and sponsorship deals. His big break came when he was invited to join the England squad for their tour to Argentina in 1990. It was a tour that precipitated one of the greatest periods in the history of the British game, and Leonard provides a compelling insight into life behind the scenes with England and his new club Harlequins as the personal records continued to tumble. Rob Andrew, Will Carling, Lawrence Dallaglio, Brian Moore, Dick Best and Clive Woodward are just some of the high-profile characters of whom Leonard has plenty of stories to tell. He also recalls some of the greats such as David Campese and Jonah Lomu, whom he has played with or against on Lions tours, for the Barbarians and in three World Cups. Once told that he would never walk again after undergoing life-saving surgery on neck, Leonard describes the torment he went through during this period, and how he fought against all the odds to re-establish himself on the international stage. With more than 80 Test caps to his name to date and a career in rugby union spanning two decades, there is no more experienced player in the modern game. With nicknames like ""The Fun Bus"" and ""The Scourge of the Barking Barmaids"", Leonard has lived a colourful and at times controversial life. All is revealed in this portrait of an English rugbylegend.",0007128134,9780007128136,400,Jason Leonard,Alison Kervin, ,3.63,19,2,Harpercollins Pub Ltd,December 12th 2002,Hardcover, ,1313-2506518.Jason_Leonard.html

347,The Autobiography of St. Ignatius,"Pyrrhus Press specializes in bringing books long out of date back to life, allowing today’s readers access to yesterday’s treasures. Of all of the important Catholic men and women who have been venerated over the last 2,000 years, one of the faith’s most popular and influential men also lived one of the most unique lives. Like Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, St. Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556) found God about as far away from church as possible; it was during military service that he underwent a remarkable conversion. A Spanish knight who hailed from a noble Basque family, Ignatius seemed destined for military glory until he was badly wounded in 1521 during the Battle of Pamplona. While convalescing, Ignatius began reading De Vita Christi by Ludolph of Saxony, after which he began a tireless career in service of the Catholic Church. After spending several years studying the faith, Ignatius formed the Society of Jesus in 1539, and as its Superior General, he sent followers as missionaries across Europe to create schools, colleges, and seminaries. The Jesuits remain active across the world nearly 500 years later. By 1548, he had published his famous Spiritual Exercises, which help the faithful commit themselves to Christ by conducting different mental exercises. The Spiritual Exercises continue to be wildly popular across the world today, even among non-Catholics. By the time Ignatius died in 1556, he was one of the most important Catholics of the Counter-Reformation, and it took less than 100 years for him to be beatified and canonized as a saint.",, ,67,John Francis O'Conor, , ,3.62,8,0,Pyrrhus Press,August 28th 2014,Kindle Edition,English,1315-23198398-the-autobiography-of-st-ignatius.html

349,The Long Distance Runner: An Autobiography,"Tony Richardson died on November 14, 1991. This book was discovered on the day of his death, hidden at the back of the same dark cupboard where he kept his Oscars. As his daughter Natasha movingly writes in her foreword, it is an ""entertaining, humorous, and very personal account of the people and places he loved, the films he made, and the things that were important to him."" Tony Richardson was born on June 5, 1928, in Shipley, Yorkshire. After Oxford University, he joined BBC Television and in 1955 set up the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre with George Devine. Richardson's time at the Royal Court, directing John Osborne's Look Back in Anger, The Entertainer and Luther, among many other productions, heralded a new departure for postwar theater. Through his films he brought this new theatrical realism to the screen. The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner, A Taste of Honey, and Tom Jones (which won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director) were among his most acclaimed movies from this period. Later films include The Charge of the Light Brigade, The Border, The Loved One, and The Hotel New Hampshire. In this candid memoir, Tony Richardson focuses on his passion for theater and film. He shares stories of working with Albert Finney, Peggy Ashcroft, Vivien Leigh, and Alan Bates in England - and Tab Hunter, Jack Nicholson, and Diana Ross, among many others, in America. We attend the rehearsals in which the young Laurence Olivier transformed himself into Archie Rice in The Entertainer, in Richardson's words ""one of the single most thrilling moments in the theatre."" And he describes directing an impossible Tallulah Bankhead in a spectacularly ill-fated production of Tennessee Williams's The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore. Richardson writes beautifully of his quiet Yorkshire upbringing, surrounded by women he both loved and feared.",0688121012,9780688121013,368,Tony  Richardson, , ,4.17,6,1,William Morrow & Company,1993,Hardcover,English,1317-1084327.The_Long_Distance_Runner.html

Janis Ian was catapulted into the spotlight in 1966 at the age of fifteen when her soul-wrenching song ""Society's Child"" became a national hit. An intimate portrait of an interracial relationship, ""Society's Child"" climbed the charts despite the fact that many radio stations across the country refused to play it because of its controversial subject matter. But this was only the beginning of a long and illustrious career. In this fascinating memoir of her life in the music business, Ian chronicles how she did drugs with Jimi Hendrix, went shopping for Grammy clothes with Janis Joplin, and sang with Mel Tormé all the while never ceasing to create unforgettable music. In Society's Child , Ian shares with readers what it felt like to move in and out of the public eye. In 1975 her legendary song ""At Seventeen"" earned two Grammy awards and five nominations. But during the 1980s she made a conscious decision to walk away from the often grueling music business to study ballet and acting. She also struggled through a difficult marriage that ended with her then husband's threat to kill her. The hiatus from music lasted for nearly a decade until, in 1993, Ian returned with the release of Breaking Silence. Rather than risk losing artistic control, she took out a second mortgage on her home to fund the record. It paid off as Breaking Silence gained Ian her ninth Grammy nomination. Now in her fifth decade, Ian continues to draw large audiences around the globe. Janis Ian has inspired generations of fans and in this moving book she shares the fascinating story of her life in music.",158542675X,9781585426751,361,Janis Ian, , ,3.85,543,116,Tarcher,July 24th 2008,Hardcover,English,132-3303074-society-s-child.html

361,Confessions of a Late Night Talk Show Host: The Autobiography of Larry Sanders,"With the wit and charm that have made him one of America's most beloved, and now most sorely missed, television personalities, Larry Sanders tells here the story behind the man -- Larry -- from his emotionally barren beginnings in Mound, Minnesota, to his 10-year run as the man millions went to bed with every night. (He had a very big bed.) ""Confessions of a Late Night Talk Show Host"" is a Hollywood autobiography like no other because it reveals all -- the loves and losses, the pain and joy, the shrinks and doctors -- and it is uproariously funny. Larry Sanders has written a book that will have the same 10-year run that his show did. Larry Sanders is no ordinary man, and this book will show America and the world how very different he is. Fueled by an enormous need to be loved and gifted with a talent beyond even his own, Sanders has risen to the top of his field -- and dropped -- while retaining all of his dignity and modesty. As he says on the first page of his story, ""I'm famous. Actually, I'm very, very, very famous."" Sanders' story is laced with the names (and some of the faces) of the thousands of celebrities who have sought his attention for a decade -- and Sanders tells the world what he thinks of all of them, even if it hurts his own feelings. ""Confessions of a Late Night Talk Show Host"" is a Hollywood tell-all that will forever change the nature of this kind of book. While Geraldo Rivera used his sexual exploits to shamelessly promote his book, Sanders uses his conquests of thousands of women to illustrate his compassion and grace. ""If it sells, it sells, "" Sanders says. ""There was never a hidden agenda."" While Roseanne used her book to promote her many personalities,Sanders's book shows how a straight-shooter can not only survive but thrive in Hollywood. Most of all, Sanders, in truthfully disclosing all aspects of his life and those of people he has never met, hopes to heal and entertain. Sanders has written a wonderfully hilarious book that will make some of his fans wish he were back.",0684812045,9780684812045,237,Garry Shandling, , ,3.06,62,4,Simon & Schuster,December 31st 1998,Hardcover,English,1328-1382712.Confessions_of_a_Late_Night_Talk_Show_Host.html

Despite sitting for more than fifty hours of taped interviews and spending many late nights at Ellingham Hall (where he was living under house arrest) discussing his life and the work of WikiLeaks with the writer he had enlisted to help him, Julian became increasingly troubled by the thought of publishing an autobiography. After reading the first draft of the book at the end of March, Julian declared: 'All memoir is prostitution.' In June 2011, with thirty-eight publishing houses around the world committed to releasing the book, Julian told us he wanted to cancel his contract. We disagree with Julian's assessment of the book. We believe it explains both the man and his work, underlining his commitment to the truth. Julian always claimed the book was well written; we agree, and this also encouraged us to make the book available to readers. And the contract? By the time Julian wanted to cancel the deal he had already used the advance money to settle his legal bills. So the contract still stands. We have decided to honour it - and to publish. This book is the unauthorised first draft. It is passionate, provocative and opinionated - like its author. It fulfils the promise of the original proposal and we are proud to publish it.

Along with sister Enya, and the other members of Clannad, Máire has always fiercely guarded her privacy. Yet in recent years - largely due to a new self confidence and discovery of Christian faith - Máire has begun to share a testimony that has inspired thousands of fans on both sides of the Atlantic. We follow her life - from idyllic innocent childhood in county Donegal, through the highs and lows of ""success"" in the public eye, the personal torment of successive relationship breakdown, and the consequences of promiscuity and drug and alcohol indulgence. Ultimately this is a story of a woman whose dream became a nightmare, and yet throughout the trauma a still small voice continued to whisper her name. In seeking out that voice she finally found her love and security she had craved all her life.",0340756136,9780340756133,0,Maire Brennan,Angela Little, ,4.44,25,1,Hodder & Stoughton Ltd,May 17th 2001,Paperback,English,1330-1728753.The_Other_Side_of_the_Rainbow.html
365,M. K. Gandhi - An Autobiography Or The Story Of My Experiments With Truth,"The Story of My Experiments with Truth is the Autobiography of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, covering his life from early childhood through to 1920. It was initiated at the insistence of Swami Anand and other close co-workers of Gandhi, for him to explain the background of his public campaigns. In 1999, the book was designated as one of the 100 Most important Spiritual Books of the 20th Century by Harper Collins publishes. Gandhiji wrote in his Autobiography that the three most important modern influences in his life were Leo Tolstoy's The Kingdom of God Is Within You, John Ruskin's Unto This Last and the poet Shrimad Rajchandra (Raychandbhai). In the last chapter, he notes, My life from this point onward has been so public that there is hardly anything about it that people do not know...

366,Let's Get to the Nitty Gritty: The Autobiography of Horace Silver,"Horace Silver is one of the last giants remaining from the incredible flowering and creative extension of bebop music that became known as ""hard bop"" in the 1950s. This freewheeling autobiography of the great composer, pianist, and bandleader takes us from his childhood in Norwalk, Connecticut, through his rise to fame as a musician in New York, to his comfortable life “after the road” in California. During that time, Silver composed an impressive repertoire of tunes that have become standards and recorded a number of classic albums. Well-seasoned with anecdotes about the music, the musicians, and the milieu in which he worked and prospered, Silver’s narrative—like his music—is earthy, vernacular, and intimate. His stories resonate with lessons learned from hearing and playing alongside such legends as Art Blakey, Charlie Parker, and Lester Young. His irrepressible sense of humor combined with his distinctive spirituality make his account both entertaining and inspiring. Most importantly, Silver’s unique take on the music and the people who play it opens a window onto the creative process of jazz and the social and cultural worlds in which it flourishes. Let’s Get to the Nitty Gritty also describes Silver’s spiritual awakening in the late 1970s. This transformation found its expression in the electronic and vocal music of the three-part work called The United States of Mind and eventually led the musician to start his own record label, Silveto. Silver details the economic forces that eventually persuaded him to put Silveto to rest and to return to the studios of major jazz recording labels like Columbia, Impulse, and Verve, where he continued expanding his catalogue of new compositions and recordings that are at least as impressive as his earlier work.",0520243749,9780520243743,282,Horace Silver,Phil Pastras,Joe Zawinul,3.48,25,4,University of California Press,March 15th 2006,Hardcover,English,1332-213043.Let_s_Get_to_the_Nitty_Gritty.html

368,Memoirs of an Arabian Princess: An Autobiography,"Authenticity Of These Memoirs THE work of which a translation is here offered originally came out as ""Memoiren einer arabischen Prinzessin."" Published by a Berlin firm in 1886, it was immediately followed by an English edition, which seems to have attracted little interest, both the German and the English versions soon falling into obscurity and going out of print. When these memoirs appeared, however, Germany's colonial ambitions were newly fledged; the British East Africa Protectorate (which includes Zanzibar) was still forming; the French had only recently withdrawn from the joint control of Egypt and Lord Cromer's sway was but just beginning; Zulu-land was an independent monarchy; the Transvaal and the Orange Free State were recognised as republics; Italian troops were yet to be severely defeated by Abyssinian blackamoors; nobody imagined that Great Britain must one day put forth all her strength to subdue fifty thousand Dutch peasants; a ""Cape-to-Cairo"" railway was unthought of. Briefly, to the world at large the Black Continent and its peoples then meant less than to-day. In connection with these memoirs arises the question of their authenticity. Historical events - like Bargash's long-continued dispute of his brother Majid's succession - anyone might have got sufficient details about for the purposes of a free narrative. But this book contains intimate revelations betokening an extraordinary knowledge of Arab life in general and of Zanzibar royal harem life in particular. Was the alleged writer, then, actually a Sultan's daughter who escaped from her country and went to live in Germany as the wife of a German merchant? So romantic a supposal seeming to require confirmation, the translator wrote to an English government official well-versed in matters pertaining to the African colonies. He received this reply, whose full import will only be appreciated after perusal of the memoirs: ""I have consulted a recognised authority - the best - who doesn't want his name mentioned, but you can take the following as absolutely trustworthy: ""The lady certainly did exist. Her name was Salamah bint Sa?d, and she took the name of Emily when she turned Christian. She was a daughter of Seyyid Sa?d, Sultan of Muscat and Zanzibar, and therefore a sister of Majid, who succeeded to the throne of Zanzibar, and of Bargash, who followed. Ruete was a German trader, and she unfortunately became enceinte by him. She escaped from Zanzibar to Aden, where her child was born, and where she married Ruete, who had also found it expedient to leave Zanzibar. ""Ruete was killed in a tram accident, and she then took the title of princess, to which she had a right by birth; whether she forfeited it by marrying Ruete, I can't say. She was taken up a good deal by high personages in Germany. Subsequently she appears to have done a good deal of intriguing with Germans - Bismarck and others - who thought they might make some use of her, but they eventually dropped her. ""She also carried on some correspondence with Sultan Bargash, but he didn't fall in with her views, declining to recognise her as having any status at all; she used to show her letters to the British agent. As for her dealings with Frere, I can learn nothing, but I expect your information is substantially correct.""",, ,307,Emily Ruete, , ,3.63,537,86,D.

376,autobiography of an orgasm,"What do we think we know about the female orgasm? It's that peak experience, an ultimate moment of climax and release that nevertheless eludes so many. Some women live for it, some have multiple orgasms, some fake it while others simply learn to do without. ""Autobiography of an Orgasm"" (November, 2014) is a sexy-spiritual memoir that's part steamy erotica and part straight-talking advice. It's the result of Betsy Blankenbaker's tireless journey to learn everything she could about the female orgasm in a personal quest to feel as much as possible after too many years of feeling nothing at all. To solve the mystery of why she spent much of her life disconnected from her sensuality, struggling to overcome the shame of childhood sexual assault, Blankenbaker set out at age 45 to thoroughly research women's orgasm. Along the way, she spent time in bed with orgasm experts, strolled down New York's tony Fifth Avenue with a healing jade egg in her vagina, had a spiritual awakening through orgasm in Africa, and received sacred ""Womb Rites"" from a shaman in the Peruvian Amazon. Through lively storytelling and a delicious sense of humor, Betsy shares why she was never able to find fulfillment in life, love or sex prior to her pilgrimage to healing and pleasure. Her findings resulted in this unprecedented book, ""Autobiography of an Orgasm."" ""Autobiography of an Orgasm"" seeks to answer the questions women have but don't know how (or whom) to ask. It is the author's fervent prayer that it will inspire women everywhere to burn their dysfunctional bridges and step into healing by learning to love their bodies and themselves.",0692323961,9780692323960,131,Betsy Blankenbaker, , ,4.60,5,2,Betsy Blankenbaker,November 2014,Paperback, ,1341-23573889-autobiography-of-an-orgasm.html
377,Autobiography of a Hobo,"From the introduction: Rather than gloat over having read the book already, or blather on about the artistic merits of the prose, let me just introduce you to a member of a ""voluntary despised minority,"" a hobo. Neither a tramp or a bindlestiff, a goofer or a snowbird, a hobo is a ""knight of the road,"" looking down upon the lowly beggars and addicts he sometimes shares his sleeping quarters with. Before being homeless was cool, and I dare say, before anyone alive today rode a train, ""Hobo"" Chandler was dodging the cops and railroad men. In a hat, coat and tie he would stow away on any train or ship he took a fancy to. Neither suffering from mental illness, drug or alcohol dependency, and having no aversion to work when it suited his purposes, Chandler traveled widely, and was able to capture the feeling of a time long gone in his words. Chandler's command of the English language is impressive, his style distinctive. His newspaper publishing credits include The Calgary Albertan and The Boston Globe. Baseball and boxing fans will find many chapters devoted to the early days of both sports. Mr. Chandler spent many hours both playing and later umpiring when injury prevented him from realizing his dreams of a major league career. Also included in the text is the famous American Boxer John L. Sullivan's last known written correspondence, addressed to the author's uncle. Please be offended by the racist remarks, but not so offended you put the book down, remember that this was written by a man who saw the next to last century turn into the twentieth. Attitudes that we consider offensive today were the cultural norm, and to ignore our history excludes us from learning its lessons. Many delightfully archaic terms of speech, exclamation points, and hyphenated words await you. This book was originally written in beautiful English Longhand, of which a sample can be found on the front leaf. The manuscript was submitted multiple times for publishing, and suffered rejections for reasons known only to publishers. After the Author's death, it took 12 years to decipher from the original Longhand onto the typewritten page, and it has taken an additional several years before this wonderful story could be made available.",1475154119,9781475154115,238,Henry Chandler,Osmond Billinge Evans, ,2.20,5,2,Createspace,April 1st 2012,Paperback,English,1342-15885666-autobiography-of-a-hobo.html

'The Autobiography of Theodore Roosevelt' is an invaluable literary work and a true gift to readers, as it is a glimpse into the psyche of such an enigmatic historical figure. Roosevelt led a life rich in accomplishments not limited to his being the youngest president in US history. He was a courageous soldier, posthumously receiving the Medal of Honor for his creation and leadership of the Rough Riders in Cuba during the Spanish-American War. He was also the first American to win a Nobel Peace prize, which he received for his negotiation of the end of the Russo-Japanese War. In addition, Roosevelt was an adventurer with a taste for hunting and exploring, especially in South America, where a river is named after him. His iconic slogan, ""Speak softly and carry a big stick,"" is still quoted and embodied by politicians to this very day, exemplifying his indelible impact on the history of the United States. http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=s...",, ,0,Theodore Roosevelt, , ,4.40,5,0,General Press,,ebook,English,1347-25127445-the-autobiography-of-theodore-roosevelt.html

385,Black Hawk: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY,"This story is told in the words of a tragic figure in American history - a hook-nosed, hollow-cheeked old Sauk warrior who lived under four flags while the Mississippi Valley was being wrested from his people. The author is Black Hawk himself - once pursued by an army whose members included Captain Abraham Lincoln and Lieutenant Jefferson Davis. Perhaps no Indian ever saw so much of American expansion or fought harder to prevent that expansion from driving his people to exile and death. He knew Zebulon Pike, William Clark, Henry Schoolcraft, George Catlin, Winfield Scott, and such figures in American government as President Andrew Jackson and Secretary of State Lewis Cass. He knew Chicago when it was a cluster of log houses around a fort, and he was in St. Louis the day the American flag went up and the French flag came down. He saw crowds gather to cheer him in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New York - and to stone the driver of his carriage in Albany - during a fantastic tour sponsored by the government. And at last he dies in 1838, bitter in the knowledge that he had led men, women, and children of his tribe to slaughter on the banks of the Mississippi. After his capture at the end of the Black Hawk War, he was imprisoned for a time and then released to live in the territory that is now Iowa. He dictated his autobiography to a government interpreter, Antoine LeClaire, and the story was put into written form by J. B. Patterson, a young Illinois newspaperman. Since its first appearance in 1833, the autobiography has become known as an American classic.",0252723252,9780252723254,192,Black Hawk,Donald Jackson, ,3.39,513,77,University of Illinois Press,March 1st 1975,Paperback,English,135-588364.Black_Hawk.html

He would not allow the book to be published until after his death, so that he could speak freely, as in a love letter.

Twain's narrative is not in any sense a mere fairy tale, many of the chapters, especially the earlier ones, are vividly true in their presentation. The things he told of Mrs. Clemens and Susy are marvelously and beautifully true in spirit and aspect, and the story as a whole is amazingly faithful in the character picture it presents of the man himself.",0766161366,9780766161368,386,Mark Twain,Albert Bigelow Paine, ,3.80,10,0,Kessinger Publishin,June 5th 2003,Paperback,English,1356-286361.Mark_Twain_s_Autobiography_Part_1.html

At one time, Stanislav Lunev could have easily been described as the villain in a James Bond film. But then he defected from Russia and did something he would have eagerly killed other people for: He told the U.S. government everything he knows. Now in his autobiography, Col. Lunev offers startling revelations about: -- Soviet assassination squads -- Soviet medical experiments on American prisoners-of-war from Korea and Vietnam -- and questions if some of them might still be in captivity -- Recruiting spies in Congress, in the military, and from the editorial offices of a leading American newspaper What shocked intelligence experts will shock American readers even more -- and unlike most spy stories, Through the Eyes of the Enemy is true.",0895263904,9780895263902,177,Stanislav Lunev,Ira Winkler, ,3.55,11,1,Regnery Publishing,August 25th 1998,Hardcover,English,1358-356114.Through_the_Eyes_of_the_Enemy.html

Auden, Miles Davis, Andy Warhol.

403,The Autobiography of Bhai Sahib Randhir Singh,"BHAI SAHIB RANDHIR SINGH (1878-1961) was an outstanding freedom-fighter and a great saint and theologian who has made a lasting contribution to the religious and cultural revival in Punjab, and was one of the first few Punjabi revolutionaries who staked their life and career to bring about political awakening and win freedom for their country. Son of a High Court Judge and educated in Govt. College and Mission College, Lahore, Bhai Randhir Singh ushered a moral and spiritual revival which set into motion what later on came to be known as Gurdwara Reform Movement. In the Rakabganj Affair (1913) it was his stern challenge to the British Government and stirring call to the people to organize resistance, which prevented the further desecration of the historic shrine. In 1914, he was the only non-emigrant Sikh leader who completely identified himself with the cause of the Ghadar Party and suffered imprisonment for seventeen long years. He is known to historians of this period as ""Hero of the First supplementary Lahore Conspiracy Case''. He is the only Sikh Leader who, in the last hundred years or more, has been given 'Hukamnamas' and Robes of Honour by the (then) four Takhats of the Panth, in solemn recognition of his sacrifices and impact on his times. His deep and original expositions of various aspects of Sikhism (more than 30 books) are a lasting contribution to Sikh theology, philosophy and mysticism. He distinguished himself in Punjabi prose and poetry by an erudite and powerful grand style of his own. This autobiography, originally compiled from his letters from the various prisons and published in Punjabi, has been translated by Dr. Trilochan Singh, who was associated with Bhai Sahib during last 20 years of his life. To the translation Dr. Trilochan Singh has added a lengthy introductory thesis, based on through research work, throwing light on Bhai Sahib’s early life and giving fairly detailed account of Bhai Randhir Singh's role in Rakabganj Affair and the Ghadar Party Revolution. Some of the facts revealed by him are a significant contribution to the history of this period. They bring to light the achievement and results of the Ghadar Revolution, and its impact on subsequent phases of Freedom Movement. This is the first electronic publication of this nature by Bhai Sahib Randhir Singh Trust UK (Registered Charity No: 1144954).

But the face he puts forth on camera is a mere part of the true Tom Arnold - also known for deciding one night in his early 20s to streak through his small Iowa town.

405,One Life: Richard E. Leakey: An Autobiography,"Richard Leakey's first official job as the administrative director of Kenya's National Museum began the very week that he contracted a serious kidney disease--one which would affect his life from that moment onwards. In January 1969, he was told by doctors in London that his own kidneys would last no longer than ten years. As it turned out, the doctors were correct; but in 1979, as a result of a kidney donated by his brother Philip, a new life began for him. And it was while he was in hospital awaiting the kidney transplant that he began his autobiography. Like his father Louis, Richard was born in Kenya and raised as an African. His extraordinary childhood is described with many of the colorful incidents that undoubtedly shaped his life. Richard and his broters had anything but a conventional childhood, growing up in a land that was itself in transition from a British colony to an independent African nation. Richard learned from both his parents, Louis and Mary, about prehistoric Africa, and he relates how he finally became involved in the study of human ancestry. This involvement ultimately led to his leadership of Kenya's museums; and these, together with his development of laboratories in Nairobi, have made Kenya one of the world's major centres for the study of evolution and human origins. Richard Leakey has lectured widely, written a variety of books, and contributed popular and scientific articles for numerous magazines and journals. He has appeared on television screens all over the world, and his most recent contribution to the media was a 7-part television series 'The Making of Mankind'. His book of the same title has become a worldwide bestseller. He lives now with his wife Meave and two of his three daughers in Nairobi. He continues to be deeply involved with the search for early human ancestors, as well as with the many facets of science which he encounters as director of Africa's leading museum.",0881620556,9780881620559,207,Richard E.

425,A Sole Survivor: Bits of Autobiography,"A brilliant author and satirist famous for his sardonic wit, Ambrose Bierce (1842-1914?) remains one of the most colorful figures in American letters. He fought in the Civil War, worked as a journalist in both the United States and England, and produced such enduring works as The Devil's Dictionary and the classic short story ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"". In 1913, he disappeared into war-torn Mexico and is believed to have died there.This book brings together, for the first time in one volume, all of Bierce's autobiographical writings; much of this material has never been reprinted since its original appearance in newspapers. The editors have organized these writings into a comprehensive account of Bierce's long life. The core of the book is ""Bits of Autobiography"", a series of eleven essays Bierce wrote about his Civil War experiences (in which he saw action at key battles such as Shiloh and Chickamauga), his adventures as a Treasury Department aide in the Reconstruction-era South, and his three years as a Grub Street hack in London. In combing through Bierce's voluminous journalism and letters, the editors uncovered many other autobiographical passages, which they have included here. These writings describe Bierce's slow rise to celebrity as a journalist in San Francisco and as a writer of tales of the Civil War and of the supernatural, his celebrated battle with the railroad baron Collis R. Huntington in 1896, and his stormy relationship with William Randolph Hearst during his long tenure with the San Francisco Examiner.",157233018X,9781572330184,356,Ambrose Bierce,S.T. Joshi,David E.

Now, in this frank and revealing autobiography, he discloses for the first time what really happened during his final weeks in power, as well as the toll that having his life—triumphs and scandals alike—played out in the public sphere took on his family and personal life. An ardent nationalist admired by European leaders, Ahern is undoubtedly an indelible presence in Irish history for the role he played in the negotiation of the Belfast agreement, his work with Bill Clinton and Tony Blair on the Good Friday agreement, and his presidency of the European Council in 2004.

434,Come Up And Get Me: An Autobiography Of Colonel Joseph Kittinger,"A few years after his release from a North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp in 1973, Colonel Joseph Kittinger retired from the Air Force. Restless and unchallenged, he turned to ballooning, a lifelong passion as well as a constant diversion for his imagination during his imprisonment. His primary goal was a solitary circumnavigation of the globe, and in its pursuit he set several ballooning distance records, including the first solo crossing of the Atlantic in 1984. But the aeronautical feats that first made him an American hero had occurred a quarter of a century earlier. By the time Kittinger was shot down in Vietnam in 1972, his Air Force career was already legendary. He had made a name for himself at Holloman Air Force Base near Alamogordo, New Mexico, as a test pilot who helped demonstrate that egress survival for pilots at high altitudes was possible in emergency situations. Ironically, Kittinger and his pre-astronaut colleagues would help propel Americans into space using the world's oldest flying machine--the balloon. Kittinger's work on Project Excelsior--which involved daring high-altitude bailout tests--earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross long before he earned a collection of medals in Vietnam. Despite the many accolades, Kittinger's proudest moment remains his free fall from 102,800 feet during which he achieved a speed of 614 miles per hour. In this long-awaited autobiography, Kittinger joins author Craig Ryan to document an astonishing career. Selected by ""Popular Mechanics"" as a Top Book of 2010",0826348033,9780826348036,256,Joe W.

The first steps towards his Beatification were begun in 1984. Born in 1928 into a modest family, against a background of endless personal trials, Marcel Van wished to become a priest. Therese of Lisieux chose him as her disciple par excellence of 'the little way'; ""Van, my little brother, just as you consider me as a saint according to your own heart, in the same way also you are truly for me a soul entirely according to my own heart...Your vocation will always be that of the hidden Apostle of Love."" If, because of poor health, Therese was unable to go to Hanoi, her heart remained in Vietnam - ""the eldest daughter of the Church in the Far East"" (Pius XI, 1933). Van was to give up his wish to become a priest and enter the Hanoi monastery as a humble Redemptorist brother; ""Jesus confided an mission to me, that of turning suffering into joy ... My joy is to love and to be loved.""

448,"Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., American: An Autobiography","Set against the backdrop of twentieth-century America, against the social fabric of segregation and the broad canvas of foreign war, Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.: American tells a compelling story of personal achievement against formidable odds. Born into an era when potential was measured according to race, Davis was determined to be judged by his character and deeds—to succeed as an American, and not to fail because of color. With twelve million citizens —the black population of the United States—pulling for him, Davis entered West Point in 1932, resolved to become an officer even though official military directives stated that blacks were decidedly inferior, lacking in courage, superstitious, and dominated by moral and character weaknesses. “Silenced” by his peers, for four years spoken to only in the line of duty, David did not falter. He graduated 35th in a class of 276 and requested assignment to the Army Air Corps, then closed to blacks. He went on to lead the 99th Pursuit Squadron and the 332nd Fighter Group—units known today as the Tuskegee Airmen—into air combat over North Africa and Italy during World War II. His performance, and that of his men, enabled the Air Force to integrate years before civilian society confronted segregation. Thereafter, in a distinguished career in the Far East, Europe, and the United States, Davis commanded both black and white units. Davis’s story is interwoven with often painful accounts of the discrimination he and his wife, Agatha, endured as a fact of American military and civilian life. Traveling across the country, unable to find food and lodging, they were often forced to make their way nonstop. Once on base, they were denied use of clubs and, in the early days, were never allowed to attend social activities. Though on-base problems were solved by President Truman’s integration of the military in 1949, conditions in the civilian community continued, eased but not erased by enactment of President Johnson’s legislative program in the 1960s. Overseas, however, where relations were unfettered by racism, the Davises enjoyed numerous friendships within the military and with such foreign dignitaries as President and Madame Chiang Kai-shek. Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., retired in 1970 as a three-star general. His autobiography, capturing the fortitude and spirit with which he and his wife met the pettiness of segregation, bears out Davis’s conviction that discrimination—both within the military and in American society—reflects neither this nation’s ideals nor the best use of its human resources.",0874747422,9780874747423,442,Benjamin O.

The first of his family to be born on dry land, Ronnie Wood came from a family of water gypsies and was raised in a council flat near Heathrow Airport. Growing up only wanting to paint and play music, Wood was always talented. And in the 1960’s, he was often in the right place at precisely the right time—becoming the guitar player for everyone from the Birds to Jeff Beck to the Faces and then to Rod Stewart . But Wood and his guitar-playing became super-charged when he joined The Rolling Stones.

457,Head On - Ian Botham: The Autobiography,"Voted the greatest English cricketer of the 20th century by the fans, Sir Ian Botham is the English game's one true living legend and his story both on and off the pitch reads like a Boy's Own rollercoaster ride. Born with a natural genius for cricket, Botham began breaking records with bat and ball from a young age and soon became the man English cricket expected most from. After a troubled period as England's captain, Botham rose once again to become a national hero with his display in the Miracle Ashes of 1981. But, with his confrontational nature and wild streak, he began regularly making the wrong kind of headlines. With accusations of drink and drugs, affairs and ball-tampering, he became hounded by the tabloid pack, never sure whether they wanted him to triumph or implode.

Beautiful, sensuous, and mysterious, she quickly became an essential Balanchine dancer-and the story of her personal life is as dramatic as they story of her rise to fame. Her account of a bizarre childhood, a magnificent if curious dance career, a charged, complicated domestic life with photographer Bert Stern, and a never-ending struggle with emotional, physical, and financial pressures is fascinating-as are her portraits of the other great dance figures who punctuated her life, from Balanchine to Baryshnikov.",0312187505,9780312187507,352,Allegra Kent, , ,4.01,206,23,St. Martin's Griffin,April 15th 1998,Paperback,English,142-34040.Once_a_Dancer.html
463,Anthony Trollope: An Autobiography,"• Two of British author Anthony Trollope’s books are bound together in this Kindle edition: An Autobiography and, Trollope’s personal favourite of his many novels, Orly Farm An Autobiography Anthony Trollope (1815 –1882) was one of the most prolific and respected English novelists of the Victorian era. In the summer of 1878, Trollope advised his son Henry that he had written a memoir and that instructions for publication were written in a letter not to be opened until his death. It read in part: ""I leave it altogether to your discretion whether to publish or to suppress the work;—and also to your discretion whether any part or what part shall be omitted. But I would not wish that anything should be added to the memoir. 1882. The memoirs were published as written, with the exception of a few passages (equivalent to about two printed pages) which Henry decided to suppress. The few footnotes are Anthony Trollope’s own additions or corrections. The first two chapters of this memoir were written in the latter part of 1875, the third chapter early in January, 1876, and that he finished the record before the middle of April 1876. Orly Farm The plot revolves around the estate of Joseph Mason, a Yorkshire man who left a codicil to his will leaving Orley Farm (near London) to his young second wife and infant son. The will and the codicil were in her handwriting, however, and a bitter legal battle ensues. A second deed is later discovered which was signed by one of the witnesses on the same date as the will, although the witness can remember signing only one document. George Orwell said the book contained ""one of the most brilliant descriptions of a lawsuit in English fiction."" Orley Farm is written in the realist mode and was Trollope's personal favourite of his many novels. About The Author English author Anthony Trollope wrote dozens of novels involving political, social, and gender issues, and on other current affairs. Sir Alec Guinness was a huge fan and reportedly never journeyed without a Trollope novel. Trollope is perhaps best known for his Barsetshire series, which is a collection of six novels (published in two volumes) and also available through Amazon: The Chronicles of Barsetshire is set in the fictitious English county of Barsetshire (located near where Dorset lies) and its cathedral town of Barchester, and they revolve around the clergy and the gentry, and the political, amatory, and social climbing.

476,Bodycage: A Transgender Autobiography,"Description Caught up in the migration boom of the 1960s, the small child moved as a ""Ten Pound Pom"" for this ""better life"" promised by her quarrelling parents. From their first new home... a dry, dusty mineral mining town in North Western Australia, Riannon relocated to a small harbour city... already aware of feeling like a fish out of water. After training in hospitality and nursing, as more of her essential self grew and unfolded, she became an exotic dancer... captivating the minds of powerful businessmen across the Far East. In an underworld, alternative community of gay, lesbian, transgender and everthing in between, Riannon followed the standards of others, finding herself exploring every area of the sex industry... from high class escort to internationally intimidating bondage Mistress. She wandered the many twisted, often dirty paths. Her journey, and all those she met, befriended, lost or buried along the way add to the triumph of self discovery and a woman's true worth. Through the eyes of the mysterious, veiled, Unknown Dancer... she became Rehana Incognito, now taking your hand on the journey to that point we can all reach... which started for herself... ... as a little boy. About the Author From a coal mining village in the North of England to a mineral mining town in Western Australia, Riannon was dragged by brawling parents as a small child to an unfamiliar, upside down world where her parents had come for a better life in the 1960s. Experiencing incomprensible racism along with an awareness of not fitting in, her world seemed shattered in many directions. Through childhood, teens and into adulthood, she looked at life from many sides... Good or bad, light or dark, power or helpnessness and all it could mean to be male or female. The journey down many of those paths took her through a unique perspective of personal growth and discovery to create her own dance and tune for the person she is today. Always keeping an open mind of observation, understanding and compassion, she tugged herself from one end of these spectrums to the other. Riannon, who became the celebrated bellydance performer Rehana Incognito, unravelled and absorbed the essence of her own powerfully, respectful femininity through the unfolding steps of Middle Eastern Dance. She now lives in Notting Hill, West London. There, with warmth, humour and hope, she encourages others searching for their centre and true self, either through the confident power of dance or the guidance of a caring hand reaching back in friendship.",1847477097,9781847477095,500,Rehana Incognito, , ,2.50,2,0,Chipmunka Publishing,July 7th 2008,Paperback,English,1432-7719270-bodycage.html

He was a rascal, running with a tough crowd, getting himself into scrapes with the Old Bill, on the verge of becoming just another nobody. Until he started to act. It came naturally to him. He landed role after role, working with big stars, making a name for himself. And then came Human Traffic , and his career went into overdrive. Fame opened doors into the best clubs, the best booze and even better drugs. But with the highs came the lows, and as the drinks flowed, the work dried up.

483,The Breaks Are Off: My Autobiography,"Drafted into the squad for the full tour of South Africa in 1999–2000, Swann's meteoric rise received a jolt. While some liked the cut of his jib, others did not and England coach Duncan Fletcher already had a foot in the latter camp when Swann missed the bus for the first of two times on that tour. Suddenly he was judged on temperament and not talent. Although Swann candidly concedes he was nowhere near good enough for the top level at that stage in his career, his jettisoning back to county cricket for the next seven years, following a solitary one-day international, hinted at a career wasted. A clash with then Northamptonshire coach Kepler Wessels triggered his move to Nottinghamshire in 2005. A County Championship winner in his debut season, he was back in the England fold at the end of his third. Forever a flamboyant showman, he made up for lost time with two wickets in his first over against India—his habit of striking in his opening over a spell has become a party piece. You cannot keep the spotlight off him for long. Since moving into the top 10 of the world rankings for bowlers on the back of eight wickets in the Ashes-defining Oval Test of 2009, he has not dropped outside it, and has been widely tipped to be the decisive factor in the defense of the urn in Australia.",1444727370,9781444727371,352,Graeme Swann, , ,4.00,6,2,Hodder & Stoughton,December 8th 2011,Hardcover,English,1439-10769110-the-breaks-are-off.html

Maureen O'Sullivan, his Jane, followed him in 1998. But their co-star Cheeta the chimpanzee, the 'World's Funniest Animal', lives on. At seventy-six, he is by some distance the oldest chimp ever recorded. Now, in his own words, Cheeta finally tells his extraordinary story. Plucked from millions of hopefuls in the jungles of Liberia, Cheeta became an international screen icon from the moment of his debut in 1934's Tarzan and His Mate . He went on to star in a further nine Tarzan pictures, and later in Doctor Dolittle with the appalling Rex Harrison, before his battles with substance abuse forced him into early retirement. He now lives happily in Palm Springs where he has re-invented himself as a globally acclaimed abstract painter. We are privileged indeed that such a legendary entertainer should grant us intimate access to the lives of the most glittering stars.

486,Memoirs of a Polyglot: The Autobiography of William Gerhardie,"Written with rare candour, this is William Gerhardie's enchanting and entertaining memoir of his early life. Gerhardie writes about his grandparents and parents, and about his childhood in St Petersburg where his father, a British cotton manufacturer, settled in the 1890s. He joined the Scots Greys in the First World War, and was commissioned and posted to the British Embassy at Petrograd, where he saw the Russian revolution in various stages. At Oxford, he wrote Futility, the first of his novels. In the 1920s and 1930s, Gerhardie was friends with many of the most interesting people of the era, from Lord Beaverbrook to the Sitwells, and he writes brilliantly and amusingly about the literary and political scene of that time. Michael Holroyd notes in his preface that 'The narrative, which contains so many percipient pen portraits, stops for no man, but merely seems to pick them up in its stride'. Memoirs of a Polyglot is illustrated with photographs, many of them from Gerhardie's family albums. 'To those of my generation he was the most important new novelist to appear in our young life.'

488,General George Crook: His Autobiography,"General George Crook was one Civil War general who didn’t win his reputation east of the Mississippi River. To him, the Civil War was just an interlude. Before and after this great conflict, Crook was an Indian fighter. Crook fought the greatest of the Indian chieftains; served at frontier posts from the Columbia River to the Rio Grande, from Illinois to the Pacific. Yet he was as good at defending Indians as he was at fighting them. Crook understood and sympathized with them. He spoke plainly and often against injustices in the treatment of the Indian. And when he died, Red Cloud, chief of the Sioux, gave him his epitaph: “He, at least, had never lied to us.” General George Crook: His Autobiography first came into print when Martin F. Schmitt, working in the archives of the Army War College in Washington, made the startling rediscovery of the Crook papers, which had been presented to the library of the War College by the widow of Walter S. Schuyler, one-time aid to General Crook. The existence of the autobiography had apparently not been previously suspected by any writer on the West, not even by the General’s friend, Captain John G. Bourke, who wrote the only existing sketch of his life. A West Point graduate of 1852, General Crook spent his entire military career, with the exception of the four Civil War years, 1861 to 1865, on the frontier. His life paralleled western expansion during the latter half of the nineteenth century. In 1890, at the time of this death, he was commanding general of the Department of the Missouri, the largest and most active of all frontier commands. The Rogue River and Yakima wars in the eighteen fifties, Paiute pacification in the late sixties, the Apache campaigns of the seventies and eighties—all found Crook actively involved, fighting, counseling and making peace with the Indians. His Civil War experiences, while not uniformly successful or profitable, brought him into close contact with the great military figures of the day. He was a favorite of Grant’s and a close associate of Sheridan, who had been in his class at West Point. His blunt, sometimes caustic opinions of his associates and the conduct of campaigns are new and often refreshing. General Crook’s autobiography covers the period from Crook’s graduation from West Point in 1852 to June 18, 1876, the day after the famous Battle of the Rosebud. The editor has supplemented it with other material, some from the Crook diaries and letters and contemporary clippings, on the other years of the General’s life.",0806119829,9780806119823,368,George Crook,Martin F.

492,"Diary and Autobiography of John Adams: Volumes 1-4, Diary (1755-1804) and Autobiography (Through 1780)","These four volumes begin the publication of the Adams archives, a collection which Edward Everett Hale called a manuscript history of America in the diaries and correspondence of a single family. The Diary, partially published in the 1850's, has proved a quarry of information on the rise of Revolutionary resistance in New England, the debates in the early Continental Congresses, and the diplomacy and financing of the American Revolution; but it has remained unfamiliar to the wider public. It is an American classic, Mr. Zolta n Haraszti said recently, about which Americans know next to nothing. Actually the Diary's historical value may well prove secondary to its literary and human interest. Now that it is presented in full, we have for the first time a proper basis for comprehending John Adams--an extraordinary human being, a master of robust, idiomatic language, a diarist in the great tradition. From none of the other founders of the Republic do we have anything like a record at once so copious and so intimate. The Autobiography, intended for John Adams' family but never finished, consists of three large sections. The first records his boyhood, his legal and political career, and the movement that culminated in American independence. The second and third parts deal with his diplomatic experiences, and serve among other things as a retrospective commentary on the Diary: they are studded with sketches of Adams' associates which are as scintillating as they are prejudiced. Parts and in some cases all of these sketches were omitted from Charles Francis Adams' nineteenth-century edition. In 1779 John Adams wrote, I am but an ordinary Man. The Times alone havedestined me to Fame--and even these have not been able to give me, much. Then he added, Yet some great Events, some cutting Expressions, some mean Hypocrisies, have at Times, thrown this Assemblage of Sloth, Sleep, and littleness into Rage a little like a Lion. Both the ordinary Man and the Lion live on in these volumes.",0674203003,9780674203006,1813,John  Adams, , ,4.67,9,1,Belknap Press,December 1st 1961,Hardcover,English,1447-1395820.Diary_and_Autobiography_of_John_Adams.html
493,Apprenticed to a Himalayan Master (A Yogi's Autobiography),"The author Sri ‘M’ is an extraordinary individual. His uniqueness lies not only in the fact that at the young age of 19 and a half, he travelled to snow clad Himalayas from Kerala, and there he met and lived for several years with a ‘real-time’ yogi, Babaji, but also that he should undertake such an unusual and adventurous exploration, given his non-Hindu birth and antecedents. The metamorphosis of Mumtaz Ali Khan into Sri ‘M’, a yogi with profound knowledge of the Upanishads and deep personal insights, born of first hand experiences with higher levels of consciousness is indeed a fascinating story. The bonus for those interested in the secrets of yoga, meditation and sankhyan metaphysics is that Sri ‘M’ is still living and easily reachable. He leads a normal life, married with two children, wears no special robes and conducts himself without pomp or paraphernalia. Someone who met him recently said, “I expected a flashy godman and instead I saw a jean clad gentleman with a smile of his face, ready to discuss my problems. In five minutes flat, I said to myself, this is no ordinary man. The peace and tranquility that enters your system is tangible”.",, ,380,Sri M.

494,"A Multitude of Sins: Golden Brown, The Stranglers and Strange Little Girls: The Autobiography","New Paperback Chapter Included Cover pic by Pennie Smith A leading figure of the punk era, Hugh was lead singer, guitarist, and main songwriter with The Stranglers, and now brings his unique style, humor, and insight to describe the story of his life. Beginning with Hugh's decision to leave The Stranglers in 1990, the book explores, in full and frank detail, why this key moment in UK music history has never been fully explained. The book also covers the heady days of early punk in London, described by someone who was at its epicenter, right there with the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and the Damned. The life and times of one of the most notorious and gifted rock groups of the 1970s and 1980s, are described in detail, including the drug busts, fights, prison terms and—in one case—the tying up of journalists. Throughout this time Hugh encountered a host of other extraordinary people—Malcolm McClaren, Joe Strummer, Kate Bush, and Debbie Harry, to name a few, and he recounts the outrageous times he lived through with them, as well as providing an inside take on the other members of The Stranglers.",0007193254,9780007193257,314,Hugh Cornwell,Martin Roach, ,3.57,42,7,HarperCollins UK,2005,Paperback,English,1449-384685.A_Multitude_of_Sins.html
495,The Race of My Life: An Autobiography,"Authored By: Milkha Singh, Sonia Sanwalka Foreword By: Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra Introduction By: Jeev Milkha Singh Milkha Singh has led a life dominated by running, running, running… From a boy who narrowly escaped death during Partition (most of his family was not so lucky), to a juvenile delinquent who stole and outran the police, to a young Army recruit who ran his very first race to win special privileges for himself (a daily glass of milk). After that first race, Milkha Singh became an athlete by default. And what followed was the stuff legends are made of. In this remarkably candid autobiography, Milkha Singh shares the amazing highs of winning India’s first ever gold in athletics at the Commonwealth Games, the unbridled joy of being hailed as the ‘Flying Sikh’ in Pakistan, as well as the shattering low of failure at the Olympics. Simple yet ambitious, famous yet grounded, Milkha Singh was a man who defined his own destiny and remained committed to running. And yet, remarkably for a man whose life was dominated by sports, he continues to remain disillusioned with the way sports is run… Powerful and gripping, The Race of My Life documents the journey of an impoverished refugee who rose to become one of the most towering figures in Indian sports.",8129129108,9788129129109,160,Milkha Singh, , ,4.17,344,61,Rupa Publications India,August 2013,Paperback,English,145-18213522-the-race-of-my-life.html

498,The French Worker: Autobiographies from the Early Industrial Era,"This anthology, drawn from the autobiographies of seven men and women whose lives span the nineteenth century, provides a rare glimpse of the everyday lives of workers in the age of early industrialization in France. Appearing for the first time in English, these stories vividly convey the ambitions, hardships, and reversals of ordinary people struggling to gain a measure of respectability. The workers' livelihoods are diverse: chair-maker, embroiderer, joiner, mason, silk weaver, machinist, seamstress. Their stories of daily activities, work life, and popular politics are filled with lively, often poignant moments. We learn of dismal, unsanitary housing; of disease; workplace accidents; and terrible hardship, especially for the children of the poor. We read of exploitation and injustice, of courtship and marriage, and of the sociability of the wine-merchant's shop and the boardinghouse. Traugott's analytic introduction discusses the many shifts in French society during the nineteenth century. Used in combination with other sources, these autobiographies illuminate the relationship between changes in working conditions and in the forms of political participation and protest occurring as the century came to a close.",0520079329,9780520079328,408,Mark Traugott, , ,3.48,23,1,University of California Press,March 25th 1993,Paperback,English,1452-2647127-the-french-worker.html

516,Raw: My Autobiography,"Antony Worrall Thompson's passage to culinary stardom has not exactly been smooth. Abandoned by his father, a Shakespearean actor, when he was just three, Antony was sexually abused and maltreated throughout his childhood. His extra-curricular activities at boarding school included pushing cars into the swimming pool and generally getting on the teacher's nerves. Antony's story very nearly came to an abrupt halt at sixteen when his face was crushed in a horrific rugby accident, which left him badly disfigured and chronically insecure. But pioneering surgery saved the day, enabling him to pursue what was to become the enduring love of his life - cooking. After much hard graft and some close encounters of the violent gangster kind, AWT's flamboyant style as a restaurateur soon bought him to the attention of cookery's cognoscenti. Things didn't always run according to plan, however - he once had to serve tinned tomato soup, tarted up with croutons and basil, to the customers in his restaurant because there wasn't time to make his own from scratch. (They loved it.) And today Antony is to the culinary establishment what a bull is to a china shop. His no-nonsense style in the kitchen is loathed by a few, but loved by millions. Stuffed with hugely entertaining anecdotes and lightly sprinkled with AWT's no-holds-barred opinions, RAW is a heartrendingly honest story of triumph over adversity. Along the way we go behind the scenes with the foodie mafia and Antony lifts the lid on a few triple-Michelin-starred scandals.

For the last 16 years, Savage has carved out a reputation as a hard man and wind-up merchant with an unerring ability to grab a headline. From deliberately getting Tottenham's Justin Edinburgh sent off in a Wembley Cup final to the ""Jobbiegate"" row with referee Graham Poll and the bust-ups with John Toshack, Rio Ferdinand, Graeme Souness, and Paul Jewell, the list is endless. Yet numerous footballing legends will testify to the skill of the midfielder, who has starred for Crewe, Leicester, Birmingham, Blackburn, and Derby and won 39 international caps for Wales.

526,Interesting: My Autobiography,"Steve Davis was just a rookie from Plumstead, south London, learning how to play from an old book his snooker-obsessed father had given him, when an encounter with Barry Hearn changed his life forever. With his backing, Steve began touring the country in a clapped-out car as an amateur. Challenging established professionals and winning titles, supported by his loyal following the Romford Roar, it wasn’t long before he progressed to the world’s stage. By the eighties, Steve had helped transform a previously shady sport into a national obsession. He and a cast of legends such as Ray Reardon, Dennis Taylor and Alex Higgins, with other young guns like Jimmy White, were doing silent battle in front of huge audiences. Tens of millions of viewers would witness the nail-biting conclusions of his world championship finals; this was snooker’s golden era. The man behind the ‘boring’ tag has always been the sport’s smartest and sharpest man.

527,Turned Towards The Sun: An Autobiography,"This is the record of a long and risk-strewn life. From Winchester, where he occasionally flummoxed the authorities, Michael Burn won a classics scholarship to Oxford, pulled out from there, dabbled in high and sometimes less high life, then in 1933, troubled by the social injustice attending mounting unemployment, went to Germany to weigh up the ideals of National Socialism. He met Hitler, was shown Dachau, was a guest at the Nuremberg party rally. Soon disenchanted, he returned to work for Geoffrey Dawson on The Times. A Commando in the war, he took part in the assault on St Nazaire, where he won the MC and was taken prisoner, to be interned in Colditz. After the war The Times sent him as staff correspondent, first to Vienna, then to Budapest with responsibility for the Balkans. He reported the fake trial of Cardinal Mindszenty, admiring his courage but unable to represent him as a champion of democratic liberty. Then, after leaving The Times, he moved, with his wife Mary, to Wales. The concluding chapters are in essence his love-story with Mary, the more unusual because he was predominantly homosexual. It is a remarkable analysis of a profound relationship. The book has many different facets: it is witty, intelligent, sometimes bruisingly frank, principled and oddly affecting.'",0859553086,9780859553087,283,Michael Burn, , ,0.00,0,0,Michael Russell Publishing Ltd,May 31st 2007,Paperback,English,1472-6019257-turned-towards-the-sun.html
528,Keeping Quiet The Autobiography,"From Gower to Flintoff, Waugh to Vaughan, Cronje to Pietersen, Paul Nixon has shared a dressing room with some of the most evocative names in international and domestic cricket—and often enraged them on the field of play. The wicketkeeper, known as his sport’s most prolific ""sledger,"" has amassed more than 20 years of stories from his career at the heart of the game and now reveals them in typically outspoken style. From ""Fredalo"" to match-fixing, Nixon has experienced some of the most notorious episodes in cricket history, possesses strident opinions on the game, and has a track record of success in the English first-class game and the Twenty20 revolution. With an emphasis on off-the-field anecdotes, Nixon also lays bare the personality that led the Australian legend Steve Waugh to compare him to ""a mosquito buzzing around in the night, that needs to be swatted but always escapes.""",0752476467,9780752476469,240,Paul Nixon, , ,4.00,11,1,The History Press,July 2nd 2012,Hardcover,English,1473-15745130-keeping-quiet-the-autobiography.html

530,Gaz : the autobiography of a league legend,"This is the story of a football champion who crammed more highs and lows into an 11-year career than just about any player of his generation. Carrying the surname of his uncle and Immortal Reg, he had blinding pace, a shimmy, a step and an innate sense of timing. Whether it was for St George Illawarra, NSW or Australia, he could seemingly sniff out a try at will.

531,Raw: My Autobiography,"Antony Worrall Thompson's passage to culinary stardom has not exactly been smooth. Abandoned by his father, a Shakespearean actor, when he was just three, Antony was sexually abused and maltreated throughout his childhood. His extra-curricular activities at boarding school included pushing cars into the swimming pool and generally getting on the teacher's nerves. Antony's story very nearly came to an abrupt halt at sixteen when his face was crushed in a horrific rugby accident, which left him badly disfigured and chronically insecure. But pioneering surgery saved the day, enabling him to pursue what was to become the enduring love of his life - cooking. After much hard graft and some close encounters of the violent gangster kind, AWT's flamboyant style as a restaurateur soon bought him to the attention of cookery's cognoscenti. Things didn't always run according to plan, however - he once had to serve tinned tomato soup, tarted up with croutons and basil, to the customers in his restaurant because there wasn't time to make his own from scratch. (They loved it.) And today Antony is to the culinary establishment what a bull is to a china shop. His no-nonsense style in the kitchen is loathed by a few, but loved by millions. Stuffed with hugely entertaining anecdotes and lightly sprinkled with AWT's no-holds-barred opinions, RAW is a heartrendingly honest story of triumph over adversity. Along the way we go behind the scenes with the foodie mafia and Antony lifts the lid on a few triple-Michelin-starred scandals. The knives (and the forks!) are very definitely out ...",0553814362,9780553814361,512,Antony Worrall Thompson, , ,4.00,7,1,Bantam,August 2nd 2004,Paperback, ,1474-2676215-raw.html
532,Savage!: The Robbie Savage Autobiography,"Robbie Savage could have been just another Manchester United reject. Instead, he used the Old Trafford scrapheap as a springboard to become one of the most instantly recognizable footballers in the Premier League, despite being told by Sir Alex Ferguson he was not good enough to stay in the class of '92 alongside David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, and Gary Neville. For the last 16 years, Savage has carved out a reputation as a hard man and wind-up merchant with an unerring ability to grab a headline. From deliberately getting Tottenham's Justin Edinburgh sent off in a Wembley Cup final to the ""Jobbiegate"" row with referee Graham Poll and the bust-ups with John Toshack, Rio Ferdinand, Graeme Souness, and Paul Jewell, the list is endless. Yet numerous footballing legends will testify to the skill of the midfielder, who has starred for Crewe, Leicester, Birmingham, Blackburn, and Derby and won 39 international caps for Wales. Behind the long blond hair, the Armani tattoo and the flamboyant cars, Savage has always been the heartbeat of his team. Savage! provides a unique insight into the extraordinary life of an elite sportsman, a colorful character and loving family man.

But before he can graduate from the seminary, he must preserve his youthful innocence from the physical, mental, and sexual abuse of...a sadistic father, a violent brother, a molesting classmate, and a secret cabal of priests hiding within the very framework of Mother Church herself. In the end, Jacob Campbell can only maintain his core self through what may be an actual epiphany, including visitations by angels and heavenly hosts--or possibly drug-induced self-delusions conjured up by exposure to hallucinogens and prescription pills.

536,Interesting: My Autobiography,"Steve Davis was just a rookie from Plumstead, south London, learning how to play from an old book his snooker-obsessed father had given him, when an encounter with Barry Hearn changed his life forever. With his backing, Steve began touring the country in a clapped-out car as an amateur. Challenging established professionals and winning titles, supported by his loyal following the Romford Roar, it wasn’t long before he progressed to the world’s stage. By the eighties, Steve had helped transform a previously shady sport into a national obsession. He and a cast of legends such as Ray Reardon, Dennis Taylor and Alex Higgins, with other young guns like Jimmy White, were doing silent battle in front of huge audiences. Tens of millions of viewers would witness the nail-biting conclusions of his world championship finals; this was snooker’s golden era. The man behind the ‘boring’ tag has always been the sport’s smartest and sharpest man. With his cool, obsessive approach, Steve rewrote the rule book and became untouchably the best player in the world and the best paid sportsman in the country.

542,Graeme Swann: The Breaks Are Off - My Autobiography: The Breaks Are Off - My Autobiography,"Graeme Swann's transformation from international outsider to England's primary match-winner and undisputed best spin bowler in the world has been remarkably rapid. Within two years of his 2008 Test debut, he had become his country's most reliable bowler, made the shortlist for the ICC's cricketer of the year award and claimed an Ashes-sealing wicket. Yet the script took many twists and turns along the way. Drafted into the squad for the full tour of South Africa in 1999-2000. Swann's meteoric received a jolt. While some liked the cut of his jib, others did not and England coach Duncan Fletcher already had a foot in the latter camp when Swann missed the bus for the first of two times on that tour. Suddenly he was judged on temperament and not talent. Although Swann candidly concedes he was nowhere near good enough for the top level at that stage in his career, his jettisoning back to county cricket for the next seven years, following a solitary one-day international, hinted at a career wasted. A clash with then Northamptonshire coach Kepler Wessels triggered his move to Nottinghamshire in 2005. A County Championship winner in his debut season, he was back in the England fold at the end of his third. Forever a flamboyant showman, he made up for lost time with two wickets in his first over against India - his habit of striking in his opening over a spell has become a party piece. You cannot keep the spotlight off him for long. Since moving into the top 10 of the world rankings for bowlers on the back of eight wickets in the Ashes-defining Oval Test of 2009, he has not dropped outside it, and has been widely tipped to be the decisive factor in the defence of the urn in Australia.",, ,416,Graeme Swann, , ,3.67,9,2,Hodder,October 13th 2011,Kindle Edition,English,1481-19184077-graeme-swann.html

546,The Course of My Life: The Autobiography of Edward Heath,"""The Course of My Life"" is not only the autobiography of one of the most distinguished figures of modern times, but a revealing panoply of twentieth-century political, international and social history.

557,White Tiger: An Autobiography of Yang Xianyi,"It all began with a dream. A young woman saw a white tiger leap into her lap. It was both auspicious and unlucky -- her son, the fortune-teller said, would grow up with no brothers, and his father's health would be endangered by his birth. That son, however, would have a distinguished career, after going through many misfortunes and dangers.The dream was prophetic. The child was his mother's only male child and his father died of illness when the boy was only five. He grew up during the wartime and period of political turmoil in China, passing through many troubles, and he has had a very distinguished career. He is Yang Xianyi, renowned scholar, translator and interpreter of Chinese and Western literature. This delightful memoir of Yang Xianyi gives a candid and entertaining account of himself as a lighthearted and mischievous young man who immersed himself in the learning of European culture, ancient and modern, when he studied at Oxford in the 1930s. But it is also the illuminating self-portrait of a deeply patriotic intellectual living in a China under the throes of change, giving rare insight into the survival of a courageous, witty and principled individual during the harsh century of Chinese liberation.",9629960702,9789629960704,328,Xianyi Yang,Yang Xianyi, ,4.20,5,1,Chinese University Press,April 9th 2003,Hardcover,English,1491-1014867.White_Tiger.html

570,Carra: My Autobiography,"Jamie Carragher is one of the most charismatic footballers of his generation. Adored by the fans, he was recently voted the most popular player in the entire Liverpool squad. Yet the young Carra came to Liverpool as an Everton fan, from an Everton family, and with Everton friends. Packed with great anecdotes, controversial opinions and large helpings of his trademark humor, this is his story. Born in January 1978 in Bootle, Merseyside, Carragher signed professional terms with Liverpool in 1996, having served a successful apprenticeship, won the FA Youth Cup and played for England Under-21s. He scored a goal in his first full game for the senior team—pretty good for a defender and very unusual for him—and his versatility was to ensure a permanent place in the starting line up before long and he is now vice Captain. In fact he is so integral to the Liverpool squad, the Kop now chants ""we all dream of a team of Carraghers"" to the tune of ""Yellow Submarine."" Raw, funny, and down-to-earth, his book is an antidote to the anodyne sports autobiography. It takes you behind the scenes of all of Liverpool and England's greatest triumphs and disasters in the company of a player who never fails to be intelligent, controversial, or just downright hilarious.",0593061039,9780593061039,512,Jamie Carragher, , ,3.98,524,37,Transworld Publishers,September 8th 2008,Paperback,English,150-5267249-carra.html

Wells in Love, secretly, knowing it would never be published in his own lifetime.

Though he had already written his published autobiography (the two volumes of Experiment in Autobiography are also available as Faber Finds), he saved his most private reflections for this, detailing his engagement in a series of romantic affairs, including his famous liason with feminist author Rebecca West, twenty-six years his junior, and his second wife, Amy Catherine Robbins.

Joe Slovo began his political life as a lawyer at the Johannesburg Bar where he was a colleague and close collaborator of Nelson Mandela in the 1950s. He also served as Mandela’s lawyer in that period. He was co-founder with Mandela of the ANC’s guerrilla movement, and became the first white person elected to the ANC national executive.

Following South Africa’s first-ever democratic election in April 1994, he won widespread respect and admiration as Minister for Housing.

590,The Autobiography of Satan (Authorized Edition),"The Story of Satan's Many Struggles, Across the History of Human Existence, to Unshackle the Human Mind, and Open the Gates to Forbidden Knowledge. From the moment of his first emergence as a single spark in the dimness of prehistory, to the more enlightening force into which he evolves across the full span of human existence, Satan, as he now clearly illustrates, has been urging human beings to open their eyes to the world around them, and to continue seeking, with unfettered minds, for ultimate answers, yet to be found. To do so he must struggle against the persistent attempts to stifle that urge by the ""spoon feeders,"" as he calls them, individuals who have insisted, within every age, and often with a bloody fist, that they, and they alone, are the possessors of the only beliefs that every human being should accept and live by, without question. As Satan traces the history of their many attempts to stop human beings from thinking for themselves, he also takes his readers on a search for the ultimate source of all evil in this world. Readers will obviously enter the book with the standard concept of Satan as a supernatural figure of evil. They will leave the book, however, with a better understanding of how such mind-twisting concepts have been used to keep people away from the ""forbidden"" knowledge that lies beyond the borders of entrenched beliefs.",, ,0,William Glasser, , ,3.33,3,0, , ,Kindle Edition, ,1518-11040889-the-autobiography-of-satan.html

The story begins with his earliest recollections of life with his Father and Mother and three sisters in Sivas, Turkey. We see life through the eyes of a profoundly awakened child and move slowly and deliberately with him through his life in Istanbul, Jerusalem, Amman-Jordan, and the United States. We learn of his observations of daily life, his meetings with remarkable teachers, training in the esoteric laws of life, monastic experiences, life as a mechanic, priesthood, and more until we find him writing books, traveling to many countries, and following his passion of discovering the mysteries of the Ancient Wisdom Teachings. Slowly, the observations of a young child give way to the young adult, then the mature man, then the selfless server. We learn what each stage of life opens for us and what it teaches us. You will be captivated by this rare glimpse into the inner thoughts of a man trained in the Teachings of the Ageless Wisdom. He dedicated his entire life to search for the Light of Wisdom and expressed his findings and understanding in speech, writing, music, songs, and selfless leadership.

I have deeply regretted that my Father did not leave a complete biography of his life, and I know that many experiences and great wisdom have been lost with his death…I will try to select only those recollections that seem to be the most important in my life.” Excerpted from Torkom Saraydarian, Autobiography; Chapter One.

592,Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones,"Musician, composer, producer, arranger, and pioneering entrepreneur Quincy Jones has lived large and worked for five decades alongside the superstars of music and entertainment -- including Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey, Ray Charles, Will Smith, and dozens of others. Q is his glittering and moving life story, told with the style, passion, and no-holds-barred honesty that are his trademarks. Quincy Jones grew up poor on the mean streets of Chicago’s South Side, brushing against the law and feeling the pain of his mother’s descent into madness. But when his father moved the family west to Seattle, he took up the trumpet and was literally saved by music. A prodigy, he played backup for Billie Holiday and toured the world with the Lionel Hampton Band before leaving his teens. Soon, though, he found his true calling, inaugurating a career whose highlights have included arranging albums for Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughan, and Count Basie; composing the scores of such films as The Pawnbroker , In Cold Blood , In the Heat of the Night , and The Color Purple , and the theme songs for the television shows Ironside , Sanford and Son , and The Cosby Show ; producing the bestselling album of all time, Michael Jackson’s Thriller , and the bestselling single “We Are the World”; and producing and arranging his own highly praised albums, including the Grammy Award—winning Back on the Block , a striking blend of jazz, African, urban, gospel, and hip-hop. His musical achievements, in a career that spans every style of American popular music, have yielded an incredible seventy-seven Grammy nominations, and are matched by his record as a pioneering music executive, film and television producer, tireless social activist, and business entrepreneur–one of the most successful black business figures in America. This string of unbroken triumphs in the entertainment industry has been shadowed by a turbulent personal life, a story he shares with eloquence and candor. Q is an impressive self-portrait by one of the master makers of American culture, a complex, many-faceted man with far more than his share of talents and an unparalleled vision, as well as some entirely human flaws. It also features vivid testimony from key witnesses to his journey–family, friends, and musical and business associates. His life encompasses an astonishing cast of show business giants, and provides the raw material for one of the great African American success stories of this century.

596,White Lightning: The Autobiography,"The world's No 1 fast bowler and the driving force behind South Africa at Test level and Warwickshire in the County Championship, provides a telling insight into the physical and mental demands on a top-class sportsman. Arriving as a shy, introverted twenty year old on the unique stage of English professional cricket from the heartlands of South Africa, Donald's learning curve with his county Warwickshire was steep. Competition for the one overseas berth, injuries and loss of form meant a tricky baptism for Donald in the county game, before Bob Woolmer arrived at Edgbaston in 1991 to reconstruct his bowling action. In this book Donald reviews his relationship with key players and backroom staff -- including Woolmer, Dennis Amiss, Dermot Reeve and Brian Lara -- and contrasts the unique team spirit during Warwickshire's trophy winning seasons with the later rifts that developed over the selection of Lara as the county's overseas player. In the Test arena, South Africa's return to the international fold in 1992, with Donald to the fore, began tentatively, leading to a fiercely fought series with Australia home and away in 1994, and culminating in the 1998 tour of England, their first since the ban. Donald's ferocious assault on Mike Atherton at Trent Bridge was one of the most hostile passages of fast bowling ever witnessed, and by the end of the summer South Africa's leading strike bowler had bagged 33 wickets. Donald has some hard-hitting opinions on the policy of 'positive discrimination' and the political pressures being put on the South African cricket administrators in the build-up to the World Cup. With his revelations concerning the rugged physical and mental approach instilled as part of his Afrikaans cricket upbringing and the touring pressures faced by the modern-day Test cricketer, Donald's book provides compelling reading.",0002188880,9780002188883,269,Allan Donald, , ,3.50,6,0,Johnathan Ball,January 1st 1999,Hardcover, ,1523-7519015-white-lightning.html

As W. H.

611,"The Autobiography of Medgar Evers: A Hero's Life and Legacy Revealed Through his Writings, Letters, and Speeches","On the evening of June 12, 1963—the day President John F. Kennedy gave his most impassioned speech about the need for interracial tolerance —Medgar Evers, the NAACP’s first field secretary in Mississippi, was shot and killed by an assassin’s bullet in his driveway. The still-smoking gun—bearing the fingerprints of Byron De La Beckwith, a staunch white supremacist—was recovered moments later in some nearby bushes. Still, Beckwith remained free for over thirty years, until Evers’s widow finally forced the Mississippi courts to bring him to justice. The Autobiography of Medgar Evers tells the full story of one the greatest leaders of the civil rights movement, bringing his achievement to life for a new generation. Although Evers’s memory has remained a force in the civil rights movement, the legal battles surrounding his death have too often overshadowed the example and inspiration of his life.Myrlie Evers-Williams and Manning Marable have assembled the previously untouched cache of Medgar’s personal documents, writings, and speeches. These remarkable pieces range from Medgar’s monthly reports to the NAACP to his correspondence with luminaries of the time such as Robert Carter, General Counsel for the NAACP in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case. Most important of all are the recollections of Myrlie Evers, combined with letters from her personal collection. These documents and memories form the backbone of The Autobiography of Medgar Evers — a cohesive narrative detailing the rise and tragic death of a civil rights hero.",0465021778,9780465021772,400,Myrlie Evers-Williams,Manning Marable, ,4.05,42,0,Basic Civitas Books,May 31st 2005,Hardcover,English,1537-1256318.The_Autobiography_of_Medgar_Evers.html

Happily married to Robina for forty-nine years he enjoys the love, friendship and support of a very close knit family with three grandchildren. The mass media at times has called him a ""religious nut"" and a ""battle scarred champion"" of a dozen crusades when he fought pornography and an ""adrenaline charged salesman"". The business community has said of him 'he could motivate an Egyptian mummy to walk' and yet others call him an 'International Business Statesman'. Church leaders refer to him as a missionary to the business world or a merchant of hope and speak widely of his generosity. He has received many honours from universities, theological colleges, governments, business and humanitarian organisations around the world. Thousands flock to hear him speak wherever he travels across the globe and his books sell at a frantic pace. One tape recording on encouragement is attributed to have reached over one million copies.

I have lived most of my adult life in the cities of the American West. Although I consider myself a religious person, I know very little about God. At first I intended this book to be about wilderness, but as I wrote it, it became an autobiography with many themes. Among these themes are wilderness, my vexed and vexing relationship with Mormonism, my moral and emotional qualities, and my family.' So begins the autobiography of educator and author Levi S. Peterson. Peterson has won a wide readership for his novels and short stories, his prize-winning biography of historian Juanita Brooks, and the essays that have appeared with regularity in western and Mormon literary and historical journals. In his autobiography, Peterson describes growing up on the Mormon frontier of rural Arizona, his growing skepticism with his Mormon faith, his teaching career at Weber State University, and his struggle to understand and master personal crises of confidence that kept him in therapy for almost two decades.

620,Stranger Than Fiction (Autobiography #1),"'This is true story of a story-teller who was enabled to turn his natural imagination and story-telling genius to the fields of statecraft and strategy and to join in fellowship with those who were to become great.' So Air Marshal Sir Lawrance Darvall describes these War Papers which made Dennis Wheatley a new kind of 'best seller' with the smallest readership that any author can ever have had; for the circulation of the Papers at the time of their writing was confined to the Chiefs of Staff, the Joint Planning Staff of the War Cabinet, and to His Majesty King George VI, who read them all with the greatest of interest. With neither special information nor privilege, Dennis Wheatley wrote of the problems that faced our war leaders in a fashion which was fresh and challenging and so eminently sensible that his views achieved an influence out of all proportion to his own expectations. The fourteen Papers range diversely from Resistance to Invasion, filled with ingenious, unorthodox and extremely practical suggestions for repulsing an invading host, to the penetrating appreciation of what was to face us After the Battle. And so remarkably sound and useful were they that in the result Wheatley became the only civilian ever to be commissioned directly into the Joint Planning Staff. Those who have never read a Wheatley novel–and there must be few who have not–will be surprised indeed at the shrewdness and versatility of the author. Wheatley devotees, and they are legion, will not be at all surprised by the way in which he turned his mind to bringing pain and grief to our enemies. And every reader, of course, will enjoy this very remarkable behind-the-scenes story of the war.",0099135906,9780099135906,414,Dennis Wheatley, , ,4.00,11,0,Arrow Books,December 31st 1976,Paperback,English,1545-1167779.Stranger_Than_Fiction.html

629,Several Ways to Die in Mexico City: An Autobiography of Death in Mexico City,"In the '80s, when author/photographer Kurt Hollander lived in New York and published The Portable Lower East , life there was particularly rough, and cops often drove yellow cabs as a method to surprise and roust its residents. Before the decade ended, Hollander moved to the equally rough climes of Mexico City, making his living writing and photographing for The Guardian , The New York Times , Los Angeles Times , and many other publications. Hollander's visual and textual extravaganza, Several Ways to Die in Mexico City , provides a perspective of this extraordinary city that could only have been caught by an observant outsider who lived in all its nooks and crannies for over two decades.

630,Sean Yates: It's All About the Bike: My Autobiography,"Before Bradley Wiggins, there was Sean Yates. Behind Bradley Wiggins, there was Sean Yates. One of only five Britons to wear the yellow jersey in the Tour de France, Sean Yates burst onto the cycling scene as the rawest pure talent this country has ever seen. After turning professional at the age of 22, he soon became known as a die-hard domestique, putting his body on the line for his teammates. Devastatingly fast, powerful, and a fearless competitor, Yates won a stage of the Tour, as well as the Vuelta a España, in 1988, and went on to don the coveted maillot jaune six years later. Having put British cycling on the map as a rider, Yates was soon in demand as a directeur sportif, using his tactical knowledge to inspire a new generation of cyclists to success. And after Team Sky came calling, Yates was the man to design the brilliant plan that saw Sky demolish the opposition in 2012, and for Bradley Wiggins to become the first cyclist from these shores to win the Tour. Straight-talking, entertaining, and revelatory, It's All About the Bike is the story of a remarkable career told from the unique perspective of a man who is immersed in the history of the sport he loves.",059307193X,9780593071939,320,Sean Yates, , ,3.70,40,4,Transworld Publishers,December 1st 2013,Hardcover,English,1554-17612804-sean-yates.html
631,Out of It: An Autobiography on the Experience of Schizophrenia,"""Out of It: An Autobiography on the Experience of Schizophrenia"" guides us through one man's mental journey through seven months of schizophrenia. While being interviewed by the emergency room psychiatrist, the white-haired man in the cowboy hat that I had seen earlier looked inside. He was handsome, and even though the man looked older, I knew that it was my step-father (but it actually wasn't). After the brief interview with the doctor, I was allowed to leave with my family for several days. I stayed with my family, explaining and joking about how I knew that the joke was on them, and that I was onto everything they had been doing. Then I took on a more depressing state, as I realized more and more that I might not ever get out of this. Since I was in some sort of coma, it was clear that they didn't know how to get me out. Of course Amelia was waiting to be in my arms, but she couldn't do it while I was in this dream-state world, then I wouldn't want to leave it. She was only trying to show me that she was standing by my bedside, crying and holding my hand, and overjoyed that I finally knew at least that she had always loved me.",0595356192,9780595356195,192,Anonymous, , ,3.67,3,0,iUniverse,May 25th 2005,Paperback,English,1555-2352028.Out_of_It.html

636,Africa in My Blood: An Autobiography in Letters,"AFRICA IN MY BLOOD is an extraordinary self-portrait in letters of Jane Goodall's early years, from childhood to the publication of IN THE SHADOW OF MAN, revealing this remarkable woman more vividly than anything published before, by her or about her. We see her at eleven founding the Alligator Society (""You have to be able to recognize 10 birds, 10 dogs, 10 trees and 5 butterflies OR moths""); at seventeen developing a crush on the local minister (""He has a beautiful long nose and he loves dogs""); at twenty punting at Oxford -- and falling out of the boat (""And I stood in the water -- up to my chest -- and roared and roared with laughter""); at twenty-two working at a film company and saving for a trip to Africa. At twenty-three, she took that trip, to ""the Africa I have always longed for, always felt stirring in my blood."" In Kenya's White Highlands, she rode horses, danced, and developed her observational skills on both animals and men (""He is very handsome & Clo & I sat in the car admiring his bottom & feeling sorry for him because he was getting filthy & oily""). The men returned her interest (""What the devil am I to do with all these middle aged married men. They hang in multitudinous garlands from every limb and neck I've got""). The turning point of her life came when a friend told her, ""If you are interested in animals, you must meet Louis Leakey."" And when she did meet the legendary anthropologist, he saw in this young secretarial school graduate the ideal candidate to undertake a revolutionary study of chimpanzees. He sent her to the Gombe Stream Chimpanzee Reserve on Lake Tanganyika, where she immersed herself in the lives of wild animals as no one had ever done before. Goodall has told this story in other books, but never so immediately and emotionally. She describes a chimp rain dance (""Every so often their wild calls rang out above the thunder. Primitive hairy men, huge and black on the skyline, flinging themselves across the ground in their primaeval display of strength and power . . . Can you begin to imagine how I felt? The only human ever to have witnessed such a display in all its primitive, fantastic wonder?""); a female chimp mating with five males early in the morning (""Hello -- No 5 is queuing, down on the bottom branch. 'Thanks Big Boy, but don't hang around.' No 5 leaps out of the way as No 4 charges down . . . Soon over & off he goes. Now perhaps a girl can have a bite of breakfast""); a colobus monkey clasping its dead baby (""She kept trying to groom its poor little coat. Oh, it was heart rending. I'm only so glad I've never seen a chimp with a dead baby. I just couldn't bear it""). AFRICA IN MY BLOOD is a dramatic, moving, funny, and important book that tells the story of how an English girl who loved animals became one of the greatest scientists of the twentieth century.",0395854040,9780395854044,400,Jane Goodall,Dale Peterson, ,4.03,319,32,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,April 15th 2000,Hardcover,English,156-32283.Africa_in_My_Blood.html

648,Running My Life: The Autobiography,"One second in time may separate the great athlete from the merely good. Seb Coe has made every second count. From an early age he has been driven to be the best at everything he does. Since the moment Coe stood alongside a 'scrubby' municipal running track in Sheffield, he knew that sport could change his life. It did. Breaking an incredible twelve world records and three of them in just forty-one days, Seb became the only athlete to take gold at 1500 metres in two successive Olympic Games (Moscow 1980 and Los Angeles 1984). The same passion galvanised Coe in 2005, when he led Britain's bid to bring the Olympic and Paralympic Games to London. He knew that if we won it would regenerate an East London landscape and change the lives of thousands of young people. It has. Born in Hammersmith and coached by his engineer father, Coe went from a secondary modern school and Loughborough University to become the fastest middle-distance runner of his generation. His rivalry with Steve Ovett gripped a nation and made Britain feel successful at a time of widespread social discontent. From sport Coe transferred his ideals to politics, serving in John Major's Conservative government from 1992 to 1997 and developing 'sharp elbows' to become chief of staff to William Hague, leader of the Party from 1997 to 2001 and finally a member of the House of Lords. Running My Life is in turns exhilarating, inspiring, amusing, and extremely moving. Everyone knows where Sebastian Coe ended up. Few people realise how he got there.

He is remembered for McClure’s Magazine , which early in the twentieth century published the works of famous authors and social reformers. He was also the mentor of young Willa Cather. After leaving her position at McClure’s in 1912, Cather ghosted this graceful portrait of her former boss. Cather’s developing style is clear throughout The Autobiography of S. S. McClure . She goes far inside her subject to find his voice and catch the rhythms of his exciting life: his immigration from Ireland to America, his Horatio Alger–like rise from poverty and struggle to success. Cather shows the risks he took in forming the first newspaper syndicate in the United States, which gave him access to such literary masters as Conan Doyle, Rudyard Kipling, and Robert Louis Stevenson. His extensive contacts were advantageous later in establishing McClure’s, the medium for muckrakers like Ida Tarbell and Lincoln Steffens. These famous figures, and many others, enter into The Autobiography of S. S. McClure , which was originally published in 1914, just as Cather was launching her own illustrious career as a novelist",0803263732,9780803263734,298,Willa Cather,Robert Thacker, ,3.67,3,0,University of Nebraska Press,March 1st 1997,Paperback,English,1576-1656689.The_Autobiography_of_S_S_McClure.html

Few scholars have had such a colorful and eventful life, the course of which he describes here. Born into a Hungarian Jewish family which later converted to Christianity, he received a Catholic education and was later ordained priest after the turmoil of the War. The quest for membership in a religious order led him to the Sion Fathers, in Louvain and then in Paris, where among other things he was introduced to biblical studies and became fascinated with the newly discovered Dead Sea Scrolls. Subsequent emotional turmoil from conflicting pressures made him ill, but a series of ""Providential Accidents"" which gave this book its title brought him to England, marriage, and a new fulfilled life, first in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and then in Oxford, and to a public reassertian of his Jewishness. As well as telling a fascinating personal story, this book provides a vivid insider's account of developments in Scrolls research and of the lengthy battle with procrastinating editors over the ""academic scandal of the century.""

657,Joking Apart: My Autobiography,"Donncha O’Callaghan is one of Ireland’s leading international rugby players, and a stalwart of the Munster side. He was a key figure in the Irish team which won the IRB 6 Nations Grand Slam in 2009, and has won two Heineken Cup medals and a Magners League title with Munster. But that success did not come easy. For a player who has been capped more than 70 times for Ireland, won two Heineken Cups with Munster, and been on two Lions tours, his long battle to make a breakthrough at the highest level is largely unknown. In this revealing autobiography, Donncha talks in detail about the personal setbacks and disappointments at Munster and the unconventional ways he dealt with the frustration of not making the team for four of five years in his early 20s. He had a parallel experience with Ireland where it took him nearly six years to get from fringe squad member to established first choice player. Here he talks candidly about his relationships with the coaches who overlooked him and the second row rivals who kept him on the bench. Donncha talks with great warmth about a hectic childhood that was shaped by the death of his father when he was only six years old. Unusually for a Cork rugby player, he came from a working class background and one of the heroes of his story is his mother Marie who showed incredible strength and resourcefulness to rear a family of six on her own. Often regarded as ""the joker in the pack,"" Donncha has worked hard, with dedication and intensity, to reach the high standards required of a professional rugby player. There have been many highs and lows along the way. His autobiography is a fascinating account of a storming career, filled with anecdotes about the players and managers he has worked with.

In this book he provided a fascinating insight into his childhood and early adult years growing up in the North East, and his working life before football in the mines of Langley Park, where he went underground for a year and a half at the age of fifteen. One of English football's most successful managers, Bobby witnessed some of the most historic sporting moments during his incredible career, including such epic incidents as the 'Hand of God' and Gazza's tears. He wrote of leading England through two World Cups and the agony of coming within a penalty kick of the 1990 World Cup final. Bobby's story takes in many countries, many clubs and many of the world's most illustrious players. He inspired deep affection for the qualities that he always embodied: passion, humour, hard work and fair play. Bobby Robson's story is a rich and diverse one; this moving and entertaining autobiography celebrates the remarkable life of a sporting legend.",, ,259,Bobby Robson, , ,4.07,28,3,Hodder,August 10th 2006,Kindle Edition,English,1583-19871270-bobby-robson.html

678,Imagine No Religion: The Autobiography of Blase Bonpane,"This is the personal story of the life of Blase Bonpane, a vanguard practitioner of liberation theology and a former Maryknoll priest. In the wake of the Second Vatican Council 1962-1965 many religious people, especially those serving in Latin America, began to understand a spirituality that transcended sectarianism. Having come from an upwardly mobile Italian American family marked by Southern Italian anti-clericalism, Blase was accustomed to hearing his parents express real differences with their institutional church. He went into the seminary despite the avid protests of his parents. Blase’s odyssey takes us from his high school and college years, through his service in Guatemala during a violent revolution, to his expulsion from that country for “subversion.” After receiving gag order from the Church, which he could not in good conscience accept, Blase met with the editorial board of the Washington Post and released all of the material he had regarding the U.S. military presence in Guatemala. This action led to his separation from the Maryknoll Fathers. Blase accepted a teaching post at UCLA. While serving in academia, he met the former Maryknoll Sister Theresa Killeen, who had served in Southern Chile. They married in 1970. Their adventures include working directly with Cesar Chavez at his headquarters in La Paz, California, building solidarity with the Central American Revolution, forming the Office of the Americas, working in the forefront of the international movement for justice and peace, and raising two children. Blase worked on the ground for international peace in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Japan and Iraq.

684,Somehow a Past: The Autobiography of Marsden Hartley,"Marsden Hartley (1877-1943) is best known as an American modernist and pioneering artist of the early twentieth century. But he was also a prolific writer who published dozens of essays and reviews and several volumes of poetry and prose. The autobiographical account of his life in the manuscript collection of Yale s Beinecke Library has often been consulted by scholars and curators writing about Hartley. It is the most revealing document he left about his personal life and relationships -- both for its disclosures and omissions -- but has never been published before.Transcribed from Hartley s own handwritten manuscripts, this edition is accompanied by photographs (some never before published), notes, and an introduction discussing Hartley s fascination with autobiography in the context of his struggle with notions of self-representation in art. Susan Ryan also describes the circumstances surrounding the composition of Somehow a Past, and explains the distinctions between this original version and two later ones also in the Beinecke Library.Somehow a Past is compelling both as historical document and as personal narrative. Although solitary, self-involved, and saturnine, Hartley nevertheless knew nearly every figure of the international avant-garde in his day and unfolds his life largely through a chain of personal encounters. His traffic with such major literary and artistic figures as Alfred Stieglitz, Vasili Kandinski, Gertrude Stein, Mabel Dodge, Eugene O Neill, Robert McAlmon, and Charles Demuth is recorded as are his travels both domestic and foreign.Somehow a Past is gossipy, discursive, and self-distanced. Hartley drafted it several times, truncating the description of his traumatic childhood, and leaving out any overt reference to his homosexuality. Yet there are moments of crystal clear self-characterization and leitmotifs that commemorate his troubled youth.""",0262581639,9780262581639,0,Marsden Hartley, , ,4.33,6,0,Mit Press,March 2nd 1998,Paperback,English,1603-1531111.Somehow_a_Past.html

708,Sing Over Me: An Autobiography,"Since 1988, I’ve been publicly sharing the story of how I walked out of a perceived homosexual identity. Why? Because I remember being a boy wondering if freedom was possible. The church didn’t have answers. The world didn’t have answers. The gay community just tried to make me give up and accept this as my innate identity. Yet, something deep inside of me kept knocking at the door of my heart saying, “There must be more. This cannot be your ultimate destiny and identity.” When God met me with the Truth of the transforming power of Jesus Christ, and I began what I call my incredible journey, I began to realize that I’d been lied to by the world and the philosophies of man. After seven years of freedom under my belt, the Lord asked me to begin publicly sharing my story because there were others out there who felt the same as I felt—that there must be more. This book is for those who want to experience God in an intimate, life-changing way, regardless of whether or not they’ve ever struggled with unwanted same-sex attraction. This is my story, yet really it’s the story of redemption found in knowing Jesus Christ intimately.",, ,196,Dennis Jernigan, , ,4.00,4,1,Innovo Publishing LLC,April 10th 2014,Kindle Edition,English,1625-22847383-sing-over-me.html

713,Running: The Autobiography,"World snooker champion Ronnie O'Sullivan's frank and honest account of his astonishingly dramatic life. Running is my drug. To be honest, drugs (and alcohol) used to be my drug, but now I've got the healthiest addiction going. Running is what has helped me fight my demons, win five world snooker championships, and cope with all the crap life's thrown at me. They say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and in this book I look at everything that hasn't killed me, but has had a good go - my addictive personality, depression, my dad's murder conviction, the painful break-up with the mother of my children, the difficulty of balancing family life with that of a sportsman. Those are the downers. But it's also about the great things in my life - my kids, snooker, my dad's release from prison, great mates who have helped me, and the psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters who has taught me how not to run away from life when it gets tricky. For the first time, I explain some of my madder moments - why I walked out in the middle of a match against Stephen Hendry, why I sat with a wet cloth over my face in a match against Mark King.

721,Writing Home: A Literacy Autobiography,"In this engrossing memoir, poet and literacy scholar Eli Goldblatt shares the intimate ways reading and writing influenced the first thirty years of his life—in the classroom but mostly outside it. Writing Home: A Literacy Autobiography traces Goldblatt’s search for home and his growing recognition that only through his writing life can he fully contextualize the world he inhabits. Goldblatt connects his educational journey as a poet and a teacher to his conception of literacy, and assesses his intellectual, emotional, and political development through undergraduate and postgraduate experiences alongside the social imperatives of the era. He explores his decision to leave medical school after he realized that he could not compartmentalize work and creative life or follow in his surgeon father’s footsteps. A brief first marriage rearranged his understanding of gender and sexuality, and a job teaching in an innercity school initiated him into racial politics. Literacy became a dramatic social reality when he witnessed the start of the national literacy campaign in postrevolutionary Nicaragua and spent two months finding his bearings while writing poetry in Mexico City. Goldblatt presents a thoughtful and exquisitely crafted narrative of his life to illustrate that literacy exists at the intersection of individual and social life and is practiced in relationship to others. While the concept of literacy autobiography is a common assignment in undergraduate and graduate writing courses, few books model the exercise. Writing Home helps fill that void and, with Goldblatt’s emphasis on “out of school” literacy, fosters an understanding of literacy as a social practice.",0809330857,9780809330850,280,Eli Goldblatt, , ,3.67,3,0,Southern Illinois University Press,April 12th 2012,Paperback,English,1637-13211392-writing-home.html

729,Touching The World: Reference In Autobiography,"Paul John Eakin's earlier work Fictions in Autobiography is a key text in autobiography studies. In it he proposed that the self that finds expression in autobiography is in fundamental ways a kind of fictive construct, a fiction articulated in a fiction. In this new book Eakin turns his attention to what he sees as the defining assumption of autobiography: that the story of the self does refer to a world of biographical and historical fact. Here he shows that people write autobiography not in some private realm of the autonomous self but rather in strenuous engagement with the pressures that life in culture entails. In so demonstrating, he offers fresh readings of autobiographies by Roland Barthes, Nathalie Sarraute, William Maxwell, Henry James, Ronald Fraser, Richard Rodriguez, Henry Adams, Patricia Hampl, John Updike, James McConkey, and Lillian Hellman. In the introduction Eakin makes a case for reopening the file on reference in autobiography, and in the first chapter he establishes the complexity of the referential aesthetic of the genre, the intricate interplay of fact and fiction in such texts. In subsequent chapters he explores some of the major contexts of reference in autobiography: the biographical, the social and cultural, the historical, and finally, underlying all the rest, the somatic and temporal dimensions of the lived experience of identity. In his discussion of contemporary theories of the self, Eakin draws especially on cultural anthropology and developmental psychology.",0691068208,9780691068206,0,Paul John Eakin, , ,4.67,3,1,Princeton University Press,May 1st 1992,Hardcover,English,1644-1434855.Touching_The_World.html

731,Design and Truth in Autobiography,"Originally published in 1960. Is there an art of autobiography? What are its origins and how has it come to acquire the form we know today? For what does the autobiographer seek, and why should it be so popular? This study suggests some of the answers to these questions. It takes the view that autobiography is one of the dominant and characteristic forms of literary self-expression and deserves examination for its own sake. This book outlines a definition of the form and traces its historical origins and development, analyses its truth and talks about what sort of self-knowledge it investigates.""",0824063759,9780824063757,202,Roy Pascal, , ,3.00,2,1,Dissertations-G,March 1st 1985,Hardcover,English,1646-3837200-design-and-truth-in-autobiography.html

741,Ran Away to Sea: An Autobiography for Boys,"1889. Reid was a popular writer of books for young people. Ran Away to Sea begins: I was just sixteen when I ran away to sea. I did not do so because I had been treated unkindly at home. On the contrary, I left behind me a fond and indulgent father, a kind and gentle mother, sisters and brothers who love me, and who lamented for me long after I was gone. But no one had more cause to regret this act of filial disobedience than I myself. I soon repented of what I had done, and often, in after life, did it give me pain, when I reflected upon the pain which I had caused to my kindred and friends.

742,Reflections Without Mirrors an Autobiography of the Mind,"For more than a half century, Louis Nizer has devoted his life to the pursuit of justice and ""the art of persuasion."" He remains one of America's most distinguished-and energetic-trial lawyers. His clients have included the most famous men and women of this century. He has been involved in cases that have probed the most controversial issues of our day. His experiences have given him a unique point from which to observe the complexities of human motivation and the role of law in our changing society. In his best-selling books My Life in Court, The Jury Returns, and The Implosion Conspiracy, Mr. Nizer brought to life for millions of readers the drama of the courtroom. Now he looks back on the whole panorama of his life in a wise and witty reminiscence of his experiences both inside and outside the courtroom-from his childhood in Brooklyn, his law school days, and his first case to the gradual building of a career that has brought him not only success but the respect that comes to those who combine excellence with moral conviction. He writes of his friendship with Adlai Stevenson, Harry Truman, and Lyndon Johnson, of ""the most remarkable group of clients I had ever known - the NASA astronauts, of his arguments before the United States Supreme Court in obscenity cases, of the famous libel cases (he has represented Elizabeth Taylor, Marlene Dietrich, Governor James Rhodes of Ohio, and Jacqueline Susann, among others) in which he sought to balance the rights of a free press with the rights of individuals, of his fond memories of New York mayors Jimmy Walker and Fiorello LaGuardia, of meetings with President Kennedy and Robert Kennedy during the Igor Cassini case, of a shocking child abuse case, of tycoons (litigations involving famous executives), and of the three occasions on which his role as counselor almost cost him his life.

But few fans, if any, could possibly identify with the anguish and turmoil that blighted his life. A staunch family man and loving father of four children, Dave's world was turned upside down when, while manager of Premier League Southampton, out of the blue he was charged with child abuse relating to his time working as a care worker. As he fought to clear his name from these totally false allegations, supported by his loyal wife Ann, who will also reveal her thoughts, Dave lost his job and, tragically, his father. What he didn't lose was his determination to tell his side of the story, even in the face of threats from those who sought to finish him.

745,How I Played the Game: An Autobiography,"Byron Nelson was one of golf's greatest legends. He was one of the finest golfers ever to pick up a putter, and the man who had the most magnificent year any golfer has ever had 1945, when he won an incredible eighteen PGA tournaments, including eleven in a row, and finished second in seven others. How I Played the Game is the beautifully told tale, in his own words, of a man determined to be the best ever: his hardscrabble rural Texas upbringing and his near-death experience with typhoid fever; his early years as a caddie at Fort Worth's Glen Garden Country Club (where as a 15-year-old he beat another young caddie named Ben Hogan in the Caddie Championship); the lean years as an amateur and as a young pro during the Depression; and the golden years of the 1940s, when he invented the modern golf swing and forged the legend of ""Lord Byron."" Even after his sudden retirement (the real reason for which is finally revealed here) his impact on the game never lessened. Besides his many years as an insightful TV golf commentator, he was mentor to several future golf champions, Ken Venturi and Tom Watson among them. And he continued to play top-caliber golf with the greats of the game, like Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, and Arnold Palmer, and some who were less than great President Eisenhower, Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and a host of others. Laced throughout with scores of priceless stories, anecdotes, opinions, and even golf tips, and with an in-depth, event-by-event recreation of his golden year, 1945, How I Played the Game is golf writing and remembrance of the highest order irresistible reading for every golfer and fan.""",1589793226,9781589793224,271,Byron Nelson, , ,3.45,11,1,Taylor Trade Publishing,June 28th 2006,Paperback,English,1659-790923.How_I_Played_the_Game.html

749,Budgie The Autobiography of Goalkeeping Legend John Burridge,"John ""Budgie"" Burridge is a true journeyman pro and a hero to football fans up and down the country. In a unique career spanning 30 years, Budgie played 771 league games for 29 teams, including Crystal Palace and QPR (under Terry Venables at both clubs), Southampton (alongside a young Alan Shearer), Manchester City, Aston Villa (where he would play against Barcelona in the European Super Cup), Wolves, and in Scotland with Hibernian where he was a hero in their League Cup win of 1991. That happy sojourn to Edinburgh would end in acrimony, however, as he ended up in a dressing-room fight with the manager. Highly respected as a goalkeeper, but denounced by many as an ""oddball"" (he admitted that he often slept wearing only his goalkeeper's gloves), Budgie was famous for his madcap antics and his pre-match stretching routines. He would also make a point of going on a lap of honor to salute his club's fans at the end of every game, win lose or drawa gesture that endeared him to legions of supporters as a man of the people. The Burridge story was far from over when he finally retired in 1997, at the age of 47. He lapsed into depression and spent months in the Priory Clinic as he struggled badly to cope with the void in his life. He became player-manager at non-league Blyth Spartansonly to later be convicted for dealing in counterfeit leisurewear. The prosecution case was significantly strengthened by the fact that there was video evidence of half the team wearing Burridge's sportswear before an FA Cup match. Together with his wife of more than 30 years, Budgie moved to Oman in the Middle East to take up a coaching post with the national team. He sustained serious injuries when he was knocked down by a car in 1999, but is back in good health. He is still employed with the Oman FA, lives there, and acts as a TV pundit and newspaper columnist in Singapore. Burridge is still fascinating and funny to this day, and in this tell-all autobiography he reveals the truth behind his astonishing football career.",1843582899,9781843582892,240,John  Burridge,Colin Leslie, ,3.67,15,3,John Blake,April 28th 2011,Hardcover,English,1662-10852964-budgie-the-autobiography-of-goalkeeping-legend-john-burridge.html

758,"Sex, Drugs & Islam: Autobiography of an X Fighter Pilot","""Sex Drugs & Islam is the provocative and controversial memoir by Pakistani author, Dari Ghaznavi. In a conversational style, Ghaznavi tells tale of his time in the military, running drugs and other criminal activity, traveling the world, and, especially, chasing women. Despite its dark topics, the narration is breezy and spirited. Dari Ghaznavi really has lived a life like no other. The title alone suggests that Ghaznavi is a man who takes chances and fears no one. Again and again, Ghaznavi puts himself in situations that would kill most people, or at least end up in an extended prison stay. That he is writing this memoir having been paralyzed from the chest down after being shot by an acquaintance should tell you this is a man who has lived, and lived hard. Through it all, Ghaznavi covers the highs and lows of his life with good humor. There's not a lot of self-deprecation or judgment here. Ghaznavi doesn't make any apologies. The book reads like Ghaznavi is regaling you with stories over dinner, which is part of the book's charm. One can't review this book without pointing out that it is highly controversial, especially in this political moment. Ghaznavi pulls no punches in his criticism of Islamic culture, and Pakistan in general. On the one hand, it's a fascinating window into a particular worldview. On the other, he's playing with fire. That's part of his story, however: his fearlessness. But there is a fair amount here that some could find offensive. All that said, as a portrait of a man who's led an extraordinarily varied and interesting life, most any reader will find Ghaznavi's memoir an eye-opening and page-turning read."" -by SPR, Self-publishing Review. According to his military instructor ""...a tumultuous and turbulent life; Enviable, deplorable, lamentable and commendable, all at once."" Dari's motivation to write this book, derives simply from his compelling desire to share with people, how not to miss out on life. He knows as he has lived it. This book is a great instruction manual on how to live or not to live. Most Readers will find it an easy read, non-stop action, sometimes graphic, but with no holds barred description on how and what happened. While there are many interesting events described, there are three principle themes that standout. Laced with cynicism, profanities and humor, this hardcore narrative starts with his childhood days in Pakistan, where he quits his low life in gangs and joins an elite group of fighter pilots in the Pakistan Air Force. After many restless years, he discovers ""America"" and the ""limitless potential"" it offers. He defies the odds and makes it happen-come hell or high water.",, ,200,Dari Ghaznavi, , ,3.18,17,4, , ,Kindle Edition,English,1670-23343318-sex-drugs-islam.html

763,My Days: Autobiography,"In his usual winning, humorous style, R. K. Narayan shares his life story, beginning in his grandmother's garden in Madras with his ferocious pet peacock. As a young boy with no interest in school, he trains grasshoppers, scouts, and generally takes part in life's excitements. Against the advice of all, especially his commanding headmaster father, the dreaming Narayan takes to writing fiction, and one of his pieces is accepted by Punch magazine (his ""first prestige publication""). Soon his life includes bumbling British diplomats, curious movie moguls, evasive Indian officials, eccentric journalists, and ""the blind urge"" to fall in love. R. K.

764,Earthly Paradise: An Autobiography of Colette Drawn from Her Lifetime Writings,"The place of Colette among twentieth-century French writers of fiction is comparable to that of Proust. But Colette's high and certain rank in literature is determined equally by her autobiographical writings as by her novels: the imaginary characters of Cheri, Gigi, Claudine, et al . can only rival, but not excel, Colette's portraits of her family and her extraordinary friends and acquaintances, from Proust himself, younger than she, to Maurice Ravel, her collaborator for the opera L'Enfant et les Sortileges . Drawn from some forty books of her non-fiction, Earthly Paradise may be described as the autobiography of her myth. It is a vivid, year-by-year revelation of a long, eager, courageous life; it is an extraordinary personal history containing scandals, marriages, motherhood, two world wars, abounding friendships; and it is a narration of the manifold stresses of a profoundly ambivalent nature. Her chronicles are tempered with suffering, self-control, work, discipline, and, above all, joy of life. ""Look!"" she once advised a young writer, ""look for a long time at what pleases you, and longer still at what pains you..."" Colette believed that to be born sentient and watchful is a miracle, and that the earthly paradise around us is as awesome an index to heaven as we shall probably know. For Colette, there was always something worth looking at--whether the petals of an orchid, or the way Sarah Bernhart poured coffee, or her own heartbreak. This lifetime pantheistic homage was not so much a ""message"" as her own form of daily prayer. Colette seems destined to become one of those rare writers whose literary achievement is something grander: a personal myth incarnating a point of view in human culture.",0374513082,9780374513085,540,Colette,Robert Phelps,Herma Briffault,4.48,131,16,Farra,January 1st 1975,Paperback,English,1676-419822.Earthly_Paradise.html

766,Awakening Lives: Autobiographies of Jewish Youth in Poland before the Holocaust,"This never-before-published collection of autobiographies written by young Polish Jews in the 1930s is extraordinary. Their candid and passionate writings not only reveal the personal struggles, ambitions, and dreams of fifteen young authors, they also offer remarkable insight into the nature of ordinary Jewish life in Poland during the years between the world wars. Later authors often view this moment through lenses tinted by nostalgia or horror. But these young writers, unaware of the catastrophic future, tell their life stories with the urgency and fervor of adolescents, coming of age during a period of manifold new opportunities and challenges. The autobiographies presented in the volume are selected from hundreds that were written for contests in the 1930s conducted by the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, then based in Vilna. Nine male and six female authors write from a variety of circumstances that reflect the great diversity of interwar Polish Jewry -- some of the authors are ardently secular, and others devoutly religious; some are impoverished and others come from the working class or middle class; some are highly educated, and others self-taught. They come from big cities, small towns, and villages; they are Zionists, Bundists, communists; they espouse multiple political affiliations or none at all. Taking up the unusual task of writing an autobiography at the threshold of adulthood, these young authors also display different personalities, writing styles, and views of life. Originally written for a pioneering research project that hoped to address the challenges facing Polish Jewish youth, their words now speak across the chasm of history, providing unique testimony on Jewish life in the final years before the Holocaust.",0300092776,9780300092776,496,Jeffrey Shandler, , ,4.10,10,4,Yale University Press,August 11th 2002,Hardcover,English,1678-499076.Awakening_Lives.html

768,The Climb: The Autobiography,"The Climb by Chris Froome - the revealing, inspirational memoir from the British winner of the 2013 centenary Tour de France The Climb tells the extraordinary story of Chris Froome's journey from a young boy in Kenya, riding through townships and past wild animals, and with few opportunities for an aspiring cyclist, to his unforgettable yellow jersey victory in this year's Tour. A journey unlike any other in the history of cycling, Froome has crossed continents, overcome the death of his mother and conquered debilitating illness to follow his dreams and represent Team GB and Team Sky.

He was educated and raised in South Africa and now races for Team GB and Team Sky. In 2011 he finished second overall in the Vuelta a Espa�a.

776,By Jack Rosenthal: An Autobiography in Six Acts,"Jack Rosenthal had always resisted writing an autobiography, until he hit on an original way of writing it that excited him—it would be as a screenplay, with himself as the central character, and the supporting cast drawn from the many wonderful and eccentric people who touched, shaped, and shared that life. What a prospect, coming from the author of such memorable classics as Bar Mitzvah Boy, The Evacuees, London's Burning, The Knowledge, and P'tang Yang, Kipperbang, a writer who uniquely won three successive BAFTA Awards.

777,"Architexts of Memory: Literature, Science, and Autobiography","In this impressively interdisciplinary study, Evelyne Ender revisits master literary works to suggest that literature can serve as an experimental laboratory for the study of human remembrance. She shows how memory not only has a factual basis but is inseparable from fictional and aesthetic elements. Beautifully written in accessible prose, and impressive in its scope, the book takes up works by Proust, Woolf, George Eliot, Nerval, Lou Andreas-Salome, and Sigmund Freud, getting to the heart of essential questions about mental images, empirical knowledge, and the devastations of memory loss in ways that are suggestive and profound. Architexts of Memory joins a growing body of work in the lively field of memory studies, drawing from clinical psychology, psychoanalysis, and neurobiology as well as literary studies. ""An important, cogently argued, subtle and rich study of a topic of great interest."" --Mieke Bal, University of Amsterdam ""A work of literary studies positioned at the intersection of tradition and innovation.

778,Saunders Mac Lane: A Mathematical Autobiography,"Saunders Mac Lane was an extraordinary mathematician, a dedicated teacher, and a good citizen who cared deeply about the values of science and education. In his autobiography, he gives us a glimpse of his ""life and times,"" mixing the highly personal with professional observations. His recollections bring to life a century of extraordinary accomplishments and tragedies that inspire and educate. Saunders Mac Lane's life covers nearly a century of mathematical developments. During the earlier part of the twentieth century, he participated in the exciting happenings in Gottingen---the Mecca of mathematics. He studied under David Hilbert, Hermann Weyl, and Paul Bernays and witnessed the collapse of a great tradition under the political pressure of a brutal dictatorship. Later, he contributed to the more abstract and general mathematical viewpoints developed in the twentieth century. Perhaps the most outstanding accomplishment during his long and extraordinary career was the development of the concept of categories, together with Samuel Eilenberg, and the creation of a theory that has broad applications in different areas of mathematics, in particular topology and foundations. He was also a keen observer and active participant in the social and political events. As a member and vice president of the National Academy of Science and an advisor to the Administration, he exerted considerable influence on science and education policies in the post-war period. Mac Lane's autobiography takes the reader on a journey through the most important milestones of the mathematical world in the twentieth century.""",1568811500,9781568811505,358,Saunders Mac Lane, , ,3.40,5,3,AK Peters,January 1st 2005,Hardcover,English,1689-1570339.Saunders_Mac_Lane.html
779,"Wins, Losses, and Lessons: An Autobiography","When I die and people realize that I will not be resurrected in three days, they will forget me. That is the way it should be. For reasons known only to God, I was asked to write an autobiography. Most people who knew me growing up didn't think I would ever read a book, let alone write one. —Lou Holtz Few people in the history of college sports have been more influential or had a bigger impact than Lou Holtz. Winner of the three national Coach of the Year honors, the only coach ever to lead six different schools to season-ending bowl games, and the ninth-winningest coach in college football history, Holtz is still teaching and coaching, although he is no longer on the gridiron. In his most telling work to date, the man still known as ""Coach"" by all who cross his path reveals what motivated a rail-thin 135-pound kid with marginal academic credentials and a pronounced speech impediment to play and coach college football, and to become one of the most sought-after motivational speakers in history. With unflinching honesty and his trademark dry wit, Holtz goes deep, giving us the intimate details of the people who shaped his life and the decisions he would make that shaped the lives of so many others. His is a storied career, and Holtz provides a frank and inside look at the challenges he overcame to turn around the programs at William and Mary, North Carolina State, Arkansas, and Minnesota. From growing up in East Liverpool, Ohio, to his early days as a graduate assistant at the University of Iowa, to his national championship runs at Notre Dame and his final seasons on the sidelines in South Carolina, Lou Holtz gives his best, a poignant, funny, and instructive look into a life well lived.",0060840803,9780060840808,336,Lou Holtz, , ,4.06,434,42,William Morrow,August 15th 2006,Hardcover,English,169-147172.Wins_Losses_and_Lessons.html

782,Just beneath My Skin: Autobiography and Self-Discovery,"Writing about oneself, says Patricia Foster, ""engages in truth but depends on the imagination, on the life just beneath the skin, a life that's impressionistic and fragile."" These eleven closely linked personal essays are at once an absorbing chronicle of a life fully undertaken and a model for anyone who has contemplated self-investigation through autobiographical writing.The book's three sections each convey a stage of Foster's journey--still ongoing--toward new levels of insight and maturity. ""Inside the Girls' Room"" takes us back to Foster's life in the rural South from the 1950s through the early 1970s. Here she reveals the mixed messages and stereotypes of southern womanhood by which she was raised-and from which she fled. With adulthood, Foster moves to ""Inside the Writing Room,"" a place dotted with discoveries about autobiography as a path to creative expression and inner coherence. Finally, at the place in her life Foster calls ""Inside My Skin,"" autobiography helps her to explore and to claim her cultural identity. Returning to her native South, she holds a writing workshop for a group composed mostly of middle-aged black women, visits a beloved maid from her childhood, and returns to old haunts as a witness to her concerns about race and class. This gathering of lyrical essays explores the intelligent, intuitive heart of a woman struggling to claim both her identity and her place in the world.",0820326887,9780820326887,190,Patricia Foster, , ,3.69,13,2,University of Georgia Press,October 11th 2004,Paperback,English,1692-220977.Just_beneath_My_Skin.html

798,The Shakespeare Diaries: A Fictional Autobiography,"What was Shakespeare thinking while he was writing Hamlet? What did he and Ben Jonson talk about when they were having a drink together? Did he meet Queen Elizabeth? What might Shakespeare have said to the formidable monarch? In The Shakespeare Diaries , J. P. Wearing, Professor Emeritus of English at the University of Arizona, blends fact with fiction to create a unique fictional autobiography of the great playwright that takes the reader into The Bard’s life like never before. The Shakespeare Diaries provides a window into Shakespeare’s world—his day-to-day life, his work, his friends and associates, and his view of daily events—thus giving readers a vivid impression of the Elizabethan era and Shakespeare’s role within that society.

MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS, an unheralded, previously unseen half-hour show of sketches, hilarities, inanities and animations, first appeared on the BBC late one night in 1969.

THE PYTHONS' AUTOBIOGRAPHY BY THE PYTHONS is a unique look at arguably the most important comic team of the modern age, with 64 pages of photographs, many culled from the team's own personal collections, many more seen for the first time.

806,Monodies and On the Relics of Saints: The Autobiography and a Manifesto of a French Monk from theTime of the Crusades,"The first Western autobiography since Augustine's Confessions , the Monodies is set against the backdrop of the First Crusade and offers stunning insights into medieval society. As Guibert of Nogent intimately recounts his early years, monastic life, and the bloody uprising at Laon in 1112, we witness a world-and a mind-populated by royals, heretics, nuns, witches, and devils, and come to understand just how fervently he was preoccupied with sin, sexuality, the afterlife, and the dark arts. Exotic, disquieting, and illuminating, the Monodies is a work in which the dreams, fears, and superstitions of one man illuminate the psychology of an entire people. It is joined in this volume by On the Relics of Saints , a theological manifesto that has never appeared in English until now.

812,The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp,"In his note to the 1920 edition of The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp , W. H. Davies states that it was written 'on the advice of friends who claimed my life of adventure would have an interest for the public.' They were not wrong. Starting with his early life in Wales, Davies documents how he was always restless as a child, having minor brushes with the local constabulary and often truanting from school. His restive demeanour continued into his youth, where he openly admits he was 'running wild, taking no interest in my trade, and determined to throw off all restraint'. Acting upon his impulsive desires, Davies embarked for America and began a life that would, for a number of years, take him the length and breadth of this life to the imagination, offering detailed accounts of his American tramping, varying from the extraordinary honour of tramps who look down on the working man, to the winter months spent in prison to avoid the cold, to the inexhaustible weakness of spending any money he saved on excessive drinking sprees. However, after a tragic accident, which Davies documents in an incredibly blasé manner, he arrives back in England with ambitions of becoming a published author. In a touchingly evocative narrative, Davies recounts his work. The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp is a fascinating read, Which takes the reader on an incredible journey through the life of a supremely talented, tragically flawed, yet undeniably unique man.",158287302X,9781582873022,0,W.H.

818,Autobiography/On Liberty,"Originally published between 1909 and 1917 under the name ""Harvard Classics,"" this stupendous 51-volume set-a collection of the greatest writings from literature, philosophy, history, and mythology-was assembled by American academic CHARLES WILLIAM ELIOT (1834-1926), Harvard University's longest-serving president. Also known as ""Dr. Eliot's Five Foot Shelf,"" it represented Eliot's belief that a basic liberal education could be gleaned by reading from an anthology of works that could fit on five feet of bookshelf. Volume XXV contains works by two great 19th-century writers: On Liberty, the greatest work from British political philosopher JOHN STUART MILL (1806-1873), often mentioned in the same breath with the Communist Manifesto; and his 1873 autobiography, in which Mill reveals how his life was inextricably connected to that of his father, Scottish philosopher James Mill. And from Mill's close friend, Scottish essayist THOMAS CARLYLE (1795-1881): the 1831 essay ""Characteristics,"" a critique of Romanticism; ""Inaugural Address at Edinburgh,"" from 1866, a fascinating and telling summary of his own intellectual history; and an 1838 piece, ""Sir Walter Scott,"" that explains the ethical rather than aesthetic foundations of his literary criticism. English philosopher and politician JOHN STUART MILL (1806-1873) served as an administrator in the East Indian Company from 1823 to 1858, and as a member of parliament from 1865 to 1868. Among his essays on a wide range of political and social thought are Principles of Political Economy (1848), Considerations on Representative Government (1861), Utilitarianism (1863), and The Subjection of Women (1869).",1616401532,9781616401535,474,John Stuart Mill,Thomas Carlyle,Charles William Eliot,0.00,0,0,Cosimo Classics,April 1st 2010,Paperback,English,1725-8589118-autobiography-on-liberty.html
819,Autobiography of an Awakening,"Autobiography of an Awakening is a portrayal of Andrew Cohen's uncompromising search for liberation, his profound awakening, and finally his painful struggle to come to terms with the discrepancy between his teacher's realization and his own. As he attempts to make sense of the confusing conduct of his teacher, Andrew is forced to question again and again the real meaning and significance of the enlightened condition. The result is a disarmingly personal story, and a fascinating investigation into the causes of the corruption so prevalent in the spiritual world today. Autobiography of an Awakening is a powerful work that reveals both the explosive implications of what it means to aspire to spiritual liberation and the extraordinary dedication that it takes for any human being to stand alone in the truth.",0962267848,9780962267840,129,Andrew Cohen, , ,3.00,2,0,What Is Enlighenment?

822,The Autobiography Of Leisure,"This long-awaited debut novella from neo-legendary sub-surface poetess Narco Pastel marks the first attempt to translate the party into a literary medium. As a pioneering entry into the Party Novel genre, The Autobiography of Leisure is designed to be digested socially, doused in a communal energy, and enjoyed with a healthy suspension of objectivity. Pastel's offering highlights the abject boredom of Modernity and attempts to replace it with an evolved dialect that centers on the importance of perpetual amusement. Contemporary society would be well-advised to heed Pastel's morality tale of secular monastic hedonism or risk asphyxiation by spectacle. Well before its official print release The Autobiography of Leisure became the first book to be banned on the internet, as the volatility of its content and subsequent response offended the Google Documents user agreement - the platform upon which the book was initially composed and distributed.",, ,108,Narco Pastel, , ,5.00,2,0,Lulu,2011,Paperback,English,1729-18045429-the-autobiography-of-leisure.html

826,The Autobiography of a Seventeenth-Century Venetian Rabbi: Leon Modena's Life of Judah,"Leon (Judah Aryeh) Modena was a major intellectual figure of the early modern Italian Jewish community--a complex and intriguing personality who was famous among contemporary European Christians as well as Jews. Modena (1571-1648) produced an autobiography that documents in poignant detail the turbulent life of his family in the Jewish ghetto of Venice. The text of this work is well known to Jewish scholars but has never before been translated from the original Hebrew, except in brief excerpts. This complete translation, based on Modena's autograph manuscript, makes available in English a wealth of historical material about Jewish family life of the period, religion in daily life, the plague of 1630-1631, crime and punishment, the influence of kabbalistic mysticism, and a host of other subjects. The translator, Mark R. Cohen, and four other distinguished scholars add commentary that places the work in historical and literary context. Modena describes his fascination with the astrology and alchemy that were important parts of the Jewish and general culture of the seventeenth century. He also portrays his struggle against poverty and against compulsive gambling, which, cleverly punning on a biblical verse, he called the ""sin of Judah."" In addition, the book contains accounts of Modena's sorrow over his three sons: the death of the eldest from the poisonous fumes of his own alchemical laboratory, the brutal murder of the youngest, and the exile of the remaining son. The introductory essay by Mark R. Cohen and Theodore K. Rabb highlights the significance of the work for early modern Jewish and general European history. Howard E. Adelman presents an up-to-date biographical sketch of the author and points the way toward a new assessment of his place in Jewish history. Natalie Z. Davis places Modena's work in the context of European autobiography, both Christian and Jewish, and especially explores the implications of the Jewish status as outsider for the privileged exploration of the self. A set of historical notes, compiled by Howard Adelman and Benjamin C. I. Ravid, elucidates the text.",0691008248,9780691008240,336,Leone Modena, , ,3.36,25,3,Princeton University Press,September 21st 1988,Paperback,English,1732-731741.The_Autobiography_of_a_Seventeenth_Century_Venetian_Rabbi.html
827,The Autobiography of Abbie Hoffman,"The Autobiography of Abbie Hoffman tells the story of one of America's most influential and imaginative dissidents, a major figure in the 1960s counterculture and anti-war movement who remained a dedicated political organizer right up until his death in 1989. With his unique brand of humor, wit, and energetic narrative, Abbie Hoffman describes the history of his times and provides a first-hand account of such memorable actions as the ""levitation"" of the Pentagon, the dropping of dollar bills onto the New York Stock Exchange floor, and the Chicago 8 Trial, which followed the demonstrations at the 1968 Democratic Convention, as well as his friendships with Jerry Rubin, Bobby Seale, Allen Ginsberg, and many others. Originally published in 1980 as Soon to Be a Major Motion Picture, this memoir has been out of print for nearly 10 years.

834,Satan: An Autobiography,"It’s said that the greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was in convincing the world that he doesn’t exist. In his latest book, Yehuda Berg uses the device of an “as told to” autobiography to explain the notion of The Adversary, an important concept in Kabbalistic wisdom. Through this playful yet serious faux-bio, readers learn that Satan resides within everyone, manifesting himself as that nagging little voice of doubt and uncertainty, and that that's how havoc is wreaked throughout the world. By doing the spiritual work that Kabbalah teaches, readers can banish negativity and evil influences from their lives, and eliminate chaos from the world. Berg takes creative license with the narrative, but he presents an accurate representation of Kabbalah’s view on the force of evil in the physical universe.",1571896104,9781571896100,256,Yehuda Berg, , ,4.21,157,21,Kabbalah Publishing,March 31st 2009,Hardcover,English,174-6261030-satan.html
835,To hell and back: the autobiography,"""Stories are like legal tender in Texas; the stranger the better. It's not that people in Texas are particularly morbid or anything. It's just that they love stories, and the best stories naturally have some bizarre aspect to them."" That's Meat's summation of his home state, and a read of To Hell And Back proves he's a Dallas boy through and through. It's fantastic to report that this is the huge, bombastic rags-to-riches-back-to-rags-back-to-riches tale that it really should be, with Meat coming across as a thoroughly charismatic madman--with thanks, no doubt, to the homely style and incisive editing of ghostwriter David Dalton. The gothic-styled To Hell And Back is replete with tales of fingerless drummers, arms-dealing managers and perpetually overdosing lead guitarists, and while Meat seems slightly horrified by his own excesses, even the doldrums are here in gory detail. ""I've blacked out the whole thing,"" says Meat, of laying Mum to rest, ""but apparently what I did at the funeral service was pull my mother out of the casket and say they couldn't have her. I actually lifted her into my arms, and people were horrified."" From the depths of cocaine psychosis, all paid for by the multi-million selling Bat Out Of Hell , Meat pulls back from the brink and when Bat Out Of Hell II makes him a superstar again, even the critics are onside. ""When Rolling Stone reviewed the concert in Madison Square Garden and gave us a rave, I nearly had a heart attack and died. I literally got dizzy, fainted"" explains Meat, proudly. Steady on, big guy--what they're saying about To Hell And Back might just spark off a full cardiac arrest. -- Louis Pattison",1852278803,9781852278809,285,David Dalton,Meat Loaf, ,3.92,239,33,Virgin,1999,Hardcover,English,1740-1876431.To_hell_and_back.html

The many permutations of words and images in all their modes of production--photograph, pose, invocation, written narrative, sculpture, dance, diatribe--create countless possibilities of expression, and this volume charts some of the ways in which women artists are seizing these possibilities.Editors Sidonie Smith and Julia Watson have been at the vanguard of the study of women's self-representation, and here have collected leading critics' and scholars' thoughts on artistic fusions of the visual and autobiographical. Marianne Hirsch, Linda Hutcheon, Linda Kauffman, Nellie McKay, Marjorie Perloff, Lee Quinby, and the other contributors offer new insights into the work of such artists as Laurie Anderson, Judy Chicago, Frida Kahlo, Orlan, and Cindy Sherman. From a painter's diary to a performance artist's ritualized enactments of kitchen domesticity, the many narratives of the self arising from these artists' negotiations of the visual and textual prove to be goldmines for analysis.Art historians, artists, critics, literary scholars in women's studies, and anyone interested in the forms and implications of depicting the self will enjoy this richly illustrated collection.Sidonie Smith is Professor of English, University of Michigan. Julia Watson is Associate Professor of Comparative Studies, The Ohio State University. They also edited Reading Autobiography: A Guide for Interpreting Life Narratives and Women, Autobiography, Theory: A Reader.",0472068148,9780472068142,496,Sidonie Smith,Julia   Watson,Julia Anne Watson,3.50,4,1,University of Michigan Press,December 20th 2002,Paperback,English,1743-1039962.Interfaces.html
839,The Life of St. Teresa of Jesus: Autobiography,"Teresa of Avila, also called Saint Teresa of Jesus, baptized as Teresa Sanchez de Cepeda y Ahumada, (March 28, 1515 - October 4, 1582) was a prominent Spanish mystic, Roman Catholic saint, Carmelite nun, writer of the Counter Reformation, and theologian of contemplative life through mental prayer. She was a reformer of the Carmelite Order and is considered to be a founder of the Discalced Carmelites along with John of the Cross. In 1622, forty years after her death, she was canonized by Pope Gregory XV and was in 1970 named a Doctor of the Church by Pope Paul VI. Her books, which include her autobiography (The Life of Teresa of Jesus) and her seminal work El Castillo Interior (The Interior Castle) are an integral part of Spanish Renaissance literature as well as Christian mysticism and Christian meditation practices as she entails in her other important work, Camino de Perfeccion (The Way of Perfection). Readers interested in basic Christian mysticism need look no further than Saint Teresa of Avila. Theresa expresses in beautiful language her deep relationship with God, and her words of wisdom and ever-hopeful outlook have inspired Christians everywhere for centuries. The Spanish Carmelite nun's autobiography provides a perfect entrance point to the world of mental prayer. She begins her story with tales of her childhood in the early 1500s--the death of her mother, how she became a nun, and the hardships of her life including illness and a period of ""lukewarmness"" during which she ceased to pray. St. Teresa also relates the visiosn and instructions she recieved form God later in her life. This book also contains St. Teresa's writings on the four states of mental prayer. In the first stage, believers learn to pray. In the second, they experience the supernatural aspect of prayer. In the third, the soul is bathed inthe pleasure of God's presence, and in the fourth, senses are abandonded in a sort of out-of-body experience where the sould feels only divine union. This book also contains a series of ""relations,"" letters she send to colleagues giving further thoughts of her beliefs. St. Teresa's warm and personal descriptions of union with God provide a wonderful and accessible starting point for engagement in her life and theology of mysticism.",1783362480,9781783362486,372,Teresa of Jesus, , ,3.60,5,1,Limovia.Net,June 4th 2013,Paperback, ,1744-18843091-the-life-of-st-teresa-of-jesus.html

841,Versions of Deconversion: Autobiography and the Loss of Faith,"In Versions of Deconversion John Barbour examines the work of a broad selection of authors in order to discover the reasons for their loss of faith and to analyze the ways in which they have interpreted that loss. For some the experience of deconversion led to another religious faith, some turned to atheism or agnosticism, and others used deconversion as a metaphor or analogy to interpret an experience of personal transformation. The loss of faith is closely related to such vital ethical and theological concerns as the role of conscience, the assessment of religious communities, the dialectical relationship between faith and doubt, and the struggle to reconcile faith with intellectual and moral integrity. This book shows the persistence and the vitality of the theme of deconversion in autobiography, and it demonstrates how the literary form and structure of autobiography are shaped by ethical critique and religious reflection. Versions of Deconversion should appeal at once to scholars in the fields of religious studies and theology who are concerned with narrative texts, to literary critics and specialists on autobiography, and to a wider audience interested in the ethical and religious significance of autobiography.",0813915465,9780813915463,238,John D.

848,Writing the Lost Generation: Expatriate Autobiography and American Modernism,"Members of the Lost Generation, American writers and artists who lived in Paris during the 1920s, continue to occupy an important place in our literary history. Rebelling against increased commercialism and the ebb of cosmopolitan society in early twentieth-century America, they rejected the culture of what Ernest Hemingway called a place of “broad lawns and narrow minds.” Much of what we know about these iconic literary figures comes from their own published letters and essays, revealing how adroitly they developed their own reputations by controlling the reception of their work. Surprisingly the literary world has paid less attention to their autobiographies. In Writing the Lost Generation , Craig Monk unlocks a series of neglected texts while reinvigorating our reading of more familiar ones. Well-known autobiographies by Malcolm Cowley, Ernest Hemingway, and Gertrude Stein are joined here by works from a variety of lesser-known—but still important—expatriate American writers, including Sylvia Beach, Alfred Kreymborg, Samuel Putnam, and Harold Stearns. By bringing together the self-reflective works of the Lost Generation and probing the ways the writers portrayed themselves, Monk provides an exciting and comprehensive overview of modernist expatriates from the United States.",1587296896,9781587296895,230,Craig Monk, , ,4.50,2,2,University Of Iowa Press,September 1st 2008,Hardcover,English,1752-6050094-writing-the-lost-generation.html

In celebration of this important milestone, here, finally, is Mark Twain's uncensored autobiography, only now free to be published in its entirety. After dozens of false starts, at last Twain embarked on his final plan for telling the story of his life. His innovative notion--to ""talk only about the thing which interests you for the moment""--meant his thoughts could range freely. The strict instruction that many of these texts remain unpublished for one hundred years meant that when they came out, he would be ""dead, and unaware, and indifferent,"" and that he was therefore free to speak frankly.

856,"I, Claudius: from the Autobiography of Tiberius Claudius (Claudius #1)","Once a rather bookish young man with a limp and a stammer, a man who spent most of his time trying to stay away from the danger and risk of the line of ascension, Claudius seemed an unlikely candidate for Emperor. Yet, on the death of Caligula, Claudius finds himself next in line for the throne, and must stay alive as well as keep control. Drawing on the histories of Plutarch, Suetonius, and Gaius Cornelius Tacitus, noted historian and classicist Robert Graves tells the story of the much-maligned Emperor Claudius with both skill and compassion. Weaving important themes throughout about the nature of freedom and safety possible in a safety and a monarchy, Graves’ Claudius is both more effective and more tragic than history typically remembers him. A best-selling novel and one of Graves’ most successful, I, Claudius has been adapted to television, film, theatre, and audio. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Robert Graves (1895-1985) was an English novelist, poet, and translator of Classical Greek and Roman literature, and one of the most prominent English writers of the 20th century. He was an extremely prolific writer, who published more than 140 novels and collections of poetry. In addition to novels and poetry, he published groundbreaking analysis of Greek mythology, as well as memoir. Graves is best known for his historical novels, which include I, Claudius, Claudius, the God, The Golden Fleece, King Jesus, and Count Belisarius. Robert Graves served in combat in World War I and was gravely wounded at the Battle of the Somme. Following his recovery, he wrote several works of war poetry as well as a memoir of his time in combat, entitled Goodbye to All That. In 1934, Robert Graves was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his historical novels dealing with the Roman Emperor Claudius.",, ,415,Robert Graves, , ,4.27,33608,"1,449",RosettaBooks,March 6th 2014,Kindle Edition,English,176-21523063-i-claudius.html
857,Dance of Reality: The Psychomagical Autobiography of the Creator of El Topo and The Holy Mountain,"A glimpse into the mind and life of one of the most creative and enigmatic visionaries of our time, filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky &bull; Retraces the spiritual and mystical path Jodorowsky has followed since childhood, vividly repainting events from the perspective of an unleashed imagination &bull; Explores the development of the author&rsquo;s psychomagic and metagenealogy practices via his realization that all problems are rooted in the family tree &bull; Includes photos from Jodorowsky&rsquo;s appearance at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and from the film based on this book, which debuted at Cannes Retracing the spiritual and mystical path he has followed since childhood, Alejandro Jodorowsky re-creates the incredible adventure of his life as an artist, filmmaker, writer, and therapist--all stages on his quest to push back the boundaries of both imagination and reason. Not a traditional autobiography composed of a chronological recounting of memories, Dance of Reality repaints events from Jodorowsky&rsquo;s life from the perspective of an unleashed imagination. Like the psychomagic and metagenealogy therapies he created, this autobiography exposes the mythic models and family templates upon which the events of everyday life are founded. It reveals the development of Jodorowsky&rsquo;s realization that all problems are rooted in the family tree and explains, through vivid examples from his own life, particularly interactions with his father and mother, how the individual&rsquo;s road to true fulfillment means casting off the phantoms projected by parents on their children. Dance of Reality is autobiography as an act of healing. Through the retelling of his own life, the author shows we do not start off with our own personalities, they are given to us by one or more members of our family tree. To be born into a family, Jodorowsky says, is to be possessed. To peer back into our past is equivalent to digging into our own souls. If we can dig deep enough, beyond familial projections, we shall find an inner light--a light that can help us through life&rsquo;s most difficult tests. Offering a glimpse into the mind and life of one of the most creative and enigmatic visionaries of our time, Dance of Reality is the book upon which Jodorowsky&rsquo;s critically acclaimed 2013 Cannes Film Festival film of the same name was based.",1620552817,9781620552810,424,Alejandro Jodorowsky, , ,4.15,537,35,Park Street Press,June 2nd 2014,Paperback, ,1760-20736544-dance-of-reality.html

866,Matters of Discretion: An Autobiography,"The first-ever autobiography written by an Indian prime minister. Only once in a lifetime comes a book that simply must be read! An absorbing, authentic and definitive account, by a former prime minister, of crucial events that had a significant impact on the nation’s destiny after independence. I K Gujral has penned his life story in a forthright and candid manner. He entered the political fray as a freedom fighter in the British era, and after the tumultuous events that rocked the Indian subcontinent in the wake of the partition in August 1947, crossed over from Pakistan to India, where he had to begin life from scratch. Despite facing tremendous odds, on the basis of his perseverance, resilience and never-say-die attitude, Gujral’s achievements allowed him to witness and shape India’s contemporary history. Gujral joined Congress Party and was first elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1964. He was the Information and Broadcasting Minister when emergency was imposed, which entailed arbitrary press censorship. Since he refused to bow down to the de facto powers, he was unceremoniously replaced and later sent by Indira Gandhi as India’s ambassador to the USSR, a post he handled with commendable tact and finesse. After his stint in Moscow, he returned to India and re-entered the ‘political whirlpool’ by joining the Janata Dal. He became minister for external affairs under V P Singh (1989) and Deve Gowda (1996). Gujral reached the pinnacle of his career when he became the prime minister on 1997. During his priministership, despite the exigencies and pressures of running a coalition government, he endeavoured to achieve progress in many spheres. The Gujral Doctrine (a set of five principles to guide the conduct of foreign relations with India’s immediate neighbours) was widely acclaimed in both India and the West. This volume, a valuable addition to the literature on contemporary history, provides a deep insight into the political scene as it unfolded after independence and delineates the roles played by a wide spectrum of politicians, bureaucrats, and many others.",, ,520,I.K.

This book is invaluable in that it presents a patient’s perspective to the reader, shedding new light on the amount of suffering a mental illness such as schizophrenia can cause. The quality of mental health care in India, the social stigma arising from such an illness when described by someone who has firsthand personal experience makes a greater impact. One of the greatest successes of the author in writing this book is in the lucid way he presents his material. We, as the reader, are taken on a journey of the life of this man right from his earliest school days till present, we read and learn about the author as a young boy, a student, and as a young man when the first symptoms of his illness begin to manifest. We then follow the whole course of the authors’ struggle with his illness, his slow, then rapid decline, and then recovery. Throughout the entire course of the narrative the author does a brilliant job of explaining the thoughts, the experiences and the struggle he experienced as a victim of mental illness in such a way that the reader is unable to read without empathizing and question how it would feel if their own mind were to turn against them in such a way. The mental health care available in India is another pertinent question that this book raises , true we have come a long way from the days of asylums and isolations, with social acceptability slowly increasing and treatments now being much more effective and available , we still have a long way to go, to reach all those who are suffering. There is a dire need for increased awareness about mental health throughout India particularly in rural areas, an issue which needs to be taken up at the national level. Works like this help to forward the cause",, ,44,Lama Surya Das, , ,2.50,4,0, , ,Kindle Edition,English,1771-18847729-the-autobiography-of-a-schizophrenic-man.html

873,The Autobiography of Obsidian Dumar,"Obsidian Dumar III, world weary, Pulitzer Prize winning author, a professor of literature at Brown in Providence, RI is stuck. After instant success with his first book his publisher asked him to write a memoir. Like many an author before him he is finding it extremely difficult to write about himself. To tell his own story requires reliving painful memories he'd long ago consigned to his private dustbin. Except as he ponders more about his life resurrecting events, images from his past, there have always been seemingly dark forces at play surrounding Dr. Dumar from a very young age. Then the letter arrives from Lula Mae Sykes. A person who says they are related and his grandfather Obsidian Dumar has died and left him to be the caretaker of the family secret. It is this letter which sets him on his epic journey through time, space and culture. He follows clue after clue contained in bits ‘n pieces of his grandfather’s “autobiography.” The only family he has ever known is the Griffins of Atlanta. The story is well known by now. Left on the doorstep of the Griffins a well-known, well-connected Atlanta family, the note tied around his neck attached to a string of canine teeth read simply. ""His name is Obsidian Dumar III."" Well it was certainly provocative for the time and place, mid 1940’s Atlanta, “White Family Adopts Negro Baby Left in Basket on Doorstep.” Many people would refer to him jokingly, derisively as The Black Moses. But this was no random choice by any means. He was left with The Griffins for a reason. Finding out that reason would now again consume him. The story takes us from 18th Century Portugal, Ireland, and Western Africa of the old world to Montserrat, New Orleans, Atlanta, and The Piney Woods of Georgia in the new. We travel back to 2500 BCE as well as see events unfold in the recent past and in the here and now. Until finally, Obsidian’s destiny is revealed and he must chose to save himself and humanity in the process.",, ,123,Walter Harris Gavin, , ,4.00,1,0, , ,Kindle Edition,English,1775-20351208-the-autobiography-of-obsidian-dumar.html

877,Where the Evidence Leads: An Autobiography,"Set in any era, Dick Thornburgh's brilliant career would merit study and retelling. He was the first Republican elected to two successive terms as governor of Pennsylvania (1979-87). He served in the United States Department of Justice under five presidents, including three years as attorney general in the cabinets of Presidents Reagan and Bush (1988-91). As undersecretary-general of the United Nations (1993), he was the highest ranking American in the organization and a strong voice for reform. Thornburgh's twenty-five-year path through the highest levels of local, state, and national government has coincided with some of the most compelling events of the American century. In this book, he follows his well-known mantra to pursue the trail of evidence wherever it leads as he candidly presents both the public and private stories of a life fully engaged with public service to his country. Nationally, Thornburgh is best remembered for his three years as attorney general, when he managed some of the most vexing legal matters of the modern age: the Savings and Loan and BCCI scandals; controversy over the ""Iraqgate"" and INSLAW investigations and the Wichita abortion clinic protests; and prosecutions of Michael Milken, Manuel Noriega, and Marion Barry, as well as those involved in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing, the Exxon Valdez oil spill, and the Rodney King beating. As governor of Pennsylvania, he faced the nation's worst nuclear accident, weeks after his inauguration in 1979. Thornburgh's cool-headed response to the Three Mile Island disaster is often studied as a textbook example of emergency management. He recounts his efforts to transform the state's ailing smokestack economy and thecontroversy over ""Thornfare,"" an early welfare-to-work program. His historic 1992 battle against Harris Wofford for the late John Heinz Ill's senate seat is one of several political campaigns, vividly recalled, that reveal the inner workings of the commonwealth's political machinery. Thornburgh reveals painful details of his personal life, including the 1960 automobile accident that claimed the life of his first wife and permanently disabled his infant son. He presents a frank analysis of the challenges of raising a family as a public figure, and tells the moving story of his personal and political crusade that culminated in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.",0822942208,9780822942207,386,Dick Thornburgh, , ,2.67,3,1,University of Pittsburgh Press,September 28th 2003,Hardcover,English,1779-2254491.Where_the_Evidence_Leads.html

A graduate of Oxford, he was slated for a career in the Civil Service, but instead he went to Romania as an apprentice-clerk in the Ottoman Bank. His next assignment was as a banana salesman in Spain; from there he lived in New York City and then as the war closed in, Household, with his command of languages, qualified as an officer in Field Security. He was sent back to Romania with a plan for destroying the oil fields before the Nazi invasion. From there he was shifted to Greece, Syria, Palestine and Persia. In the final chapters Household addresses the writer's craft and his personal aspirations.

The editors of the ""Stimmen Aus Maria Laach,"" the German review, as well as those of the English magazine, ""The Month,"" tell us that it, more than any other work, gives an insight into the spiritual life of St. Ignatius. Few works in ascetical literature, except the writings of St. Teresa and St. Augustine, impart such a knowledge of the soul. To understand fully the Spiritual Exercises, we should know something of the man who wrote them. In this life of St. Ignatius, told in his own words, we acquire an intimate knowledge of the author of the Exercises. We discern the Saint's natural disposition, which was the foundation of his spiritual character. We learn of his conversion, his trials, the obstacles in his way, the heroism with which he accomplished his great mission.

884,In My Own Words: The Autobiography,"One of the greatest GAA footballers of the modern era, Paul Galvin has enjoyed a brilliant and at times controversial career. Winning four senior All Ireland medals with Kerry and eight Munster championships, he was also a three-time All Star and 2009 Footballer of the Year. His inter-county career took off in the late 1990s, when he picked up a Munster minor championship medal in 1997 and another at under-21 level in 1999. But it was in the senior team throughout the 2000s that Paul came into his own. In a period defined by great rivalry with Tyrone, he became a key playmaker for Kerry, never failing to give his all in pursuit of victory. Over the course of a career marked by courage, physicality and an intense passion for the Green and Gold, there were many glorious days. There were other days too, with controversial incidents that led to a number of suspensions, most notably in 2008, the year in which Paul also had the honour of being the Kerry captain. 2009 brought redemption. But 2010 presented new challenges. In this fiercely honest autobiography, Paul offers – in his own words – a compelling, unflinching account of a career that has fascinated football fans for over a decade.",1848272057,9781848272057,272,Paul Galvin, , ,3.00,7,0,Transworld Ireland,October 30th 2014,Paperback, ,1785-23347226-in-my-own-words.html
885,Out of This Century: The Autobiography of Peggy Guggenheim,"Known as 'the Mistress of modern art', Peggy Guggenheim was a passionate collector and major patron. She amassed one of the most important collections of early 20th century European and American art embracing cubism, surrealism and expressionism. A 'poor little rich girl', (her father, Benjamin, went down with the Titanic in 1912), she was magnetically drawn to the avant-garde artistic community of Paris. She bought works by, and befriended, such artists as Picasso, Duchamp, Man Ray and Dali. In 1938 she opened her first gallery of modern art in London, followed by the 'Art of this Century' gallery in New York. Then, after a 4-year marriage to Max Ernst, she returned to Europe, setting up her collection in Venice where she lived until her death in 1979. This is the fascinating autobiography of a society heiress who became the bohemian doyenne of the art world. Written in her own words it is the frank and outspoken story of her life and loves: her stormy relationships with such men as Max Ernst and Jackson Pollock, of artistic discoveries and the excitement of promoting great work.

906,The Story of My Heart: My Autobiography,"This is not an autobiography in the ordinary sense of the word, as it contains no history of the events of Richard Jefferies' life. It is not concerned with his birth or marriage, his actions or fortunes but is an outpouring of his soul. Like many others, Jefferies found himself at odds with the world. He saw the beauty of the land, the grandeur of the sea, the interest of life - above all of human life - but he was not satisfied. He longed for more beauty, a fuller grandeur, a deeper interest. This feeling completely mastered him, and in this book, first published in 1883, he poured out with what strength he possessed the intensity of his longing.",1903998190,9781903998199,128,Richard Jefferies, , ,3.85,86,15,Green Books,January 1st 2003,Paperback,English,1805-2003492.The_Story_of_My_Heart.html

915,My Way: An Autobiography,"teen idol of the 1950s who virtually invented the singer/songwriter/heartthrob combination that still tops pop music today, Paul Anka rocketed to fame with a slew of hits—from “Diana” to “Put Your Head on my Shoulder”—that earned him a place touring with the major stars of his era, including Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Buddy Holly. He wrote Holly’s last hit, and just missed joining the rocker on his final, fatal plane flight. Anka also stepped in front of the camera in the teen beach-party movie era, scoring the movies and romancing their starlets, including Annette Funicello. When the British invasion made his fans swoon for a new style of music—and musician--Anka made sure he wasn’t conquered. A rapier-canny businessman and image-builder who took his career into his own hands—just as he had from the very beginning, swiping his mother’s car at fourteen to drive himself, underage, to his first gigs in Quebec—Anka toured the world until he could return home in triumph. A charter member of the Rat Pack, he wrote the theme music for The Tonight Show as well as his friend Frank Sinatra’s anthem “My Way”. By the 1970s, a multi-decade string of pop chart-toppers, including “Puppy Love” and “(You’re) Having My Baby”, cemented his status as an icon. My Way is bursting with rich, rollicking stories of the business and the people in Anka’s life: Elizabeth Taylor, Dodi Fayed, Tom Jones, Michael Jackson, Adnan Khashoggi, Little Richard, Brooke Shields, Johnny Roselli, Sammy Davis, Jr., Brigitte Bardot, Barnum & Bailey Circus acrobats, and many more. Anka is forthcoming, funny and smart as a whip about the business he’s been in for almost six decades. My Way moves from New York to Vegas, from the casino stage to backstages all over the world. It’s the most entertaining autobiography of the year.",, ,385,Paul Anka,David Dalton, ,2.91,180,54,St. Martin's Press,April 9th 2013,Kindle Edition,English,1813-18917982-my-way.html

924,Ulrike Ottinger: The Autobiography of Art Cinema,"Since 1974, German filmmaker Ulrike Ottinger has created a substantial body of films that explore a world of difference defined by the tension and transfer between settled and nomadic ways of life. In many of her films, including Exile Shanghai, an experimental documentary about the Jews of Shanghai, and Joan of Arc of Mongolia, in which passengers on the Trans-Siberian Express are abducted by Mongolian bandits, she also probes the encounter with the other, whether exotic or simply unpredictable. In Ulrike Ottinger Laurence A. Rickels offers a series of sensitive and original analyses of Ottinger’s films, as well as her more recent photographic artworks, situated within a dazzling thought experiment centered on the history of art cinema through the turn of the twenty-first century. In addition to commemorating the death of a once-vital art form, this book also affirms Ottinger’s defiantly optimistic turn toward the documentary film as a means of mediating present clashes between tradition and modernity, between the local and the global. Widely regarded as a singular and provocative talent, Ottinger’s conspicuous absence from critical discourse is, for Rickels, symptomatic of the art cinema’s demise. Incorporating interviews he conducted with Ottinger and illustrated with stunning examples from her photographic oeuvre, this book takes up the challenges posed by Ottinger’s filmography to interrogate, ultimately, the very practice-and possibility-of art cinema today. Laurence A. Rickels is professor of German and comparative literature at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the author of several books, including The Case of California, The Vampire Lectures, and the three-volume Nazi Psychoanalysis (all published by Minnesota). He is a recognized art writer whose reflections on contemporary visual art appear regularly in numerous exhibition catalogues as well as in Artforum, artUS, and Flash Art.",0816653313,9780816653317,288,Laurence A.

Inside Out is one story behind the stereotypes - the autobiography of a young Native man, James Tyman, who grew up with racism, turned to crime and self-destruction, and ended up in jail. Repeatedly.

931,"The Autobiography of Mina Loy: ""Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose"" and ""Colossus""","Mina Loy's long narrative poem Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose (1923-25) has been compared by eminent critics to Eliot's The Waste Land, Williams' Paterson, and Crane's The Bridge -- it is a major work of modernism, obscured for too long by Loy's gender and by her unconventional approach to a literary career, but now finally on the verge of recognition by a general audience. Last year Farrar, Straus and Giroux published both Becoming Modern, a biography of Mina Loy by Carolyn Burke; and The Lost Lunar Baedeker, poems selected and edited by Roger L. Conover, which has sold 4500 copies in hardcover. Roger L. Conover, Loy's literary executor, omitted Loy's major work, Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose from The Lost Lunar Baedeker because, as he explained in his notes to that volume, a page limit forced him to opt for a comprehensive book of shorter poems. Exact Change is therefore very proud to announce the first publication of Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose since 1982, when the Jargon Society printed a small edition that quickly went out of print. Roger L. Conover has decided to mark this republication of Loy's major work with the debut of an important unpublished manuscript: Colossus, Loy's roman a clef describing her affair with dada poet and boxer Arthur Cravan, whose enigmatic disappearance within months of their marriage left Loy haunted for the rest of her life. As Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose presents in elliptical form the autobiographical sources of Loy's art -- a personal history marked by emotional deprivation, sexual war, and exile -- the combination with Colossus makes this truly The Autobiography of Mina Loy. The book also contains previously unknown documents from Conover's extensiveLoy/Cravan archive.",187897226X,9781878972262,224,Mina Loy, , ,4.60,5,0,Exact Change,March 1st 1999,Paperback,English,1828-4829344-the-autobiography-of-mina-loy.html

933,David Jason: The Autobiography,"The long-awaited autobiography of one of Britain's best-loved actors.Born the son of a Billingsgate market porter at the height of the Second World War, David Jason spent his early life dodging bombs and bullies, both with impish good timing. Giving up on an unloved career as an electrician, he turned his attention to acting and soon, through a natural talent for making people laugh, found himself working with the leading lights of British comedy in the 1960s and '70s: Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Bob Monkhouse and Ronnie Barker. Barker would become a mentor to David, leading to hugely successful stints in Porridge and Open All Hours. It wasn't until 1981, kitted out with a sheepskin jacket, a flat cap, and a clapped-out Reliant Regal, that David found the part that would capture the nation's hearts: the beloved Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter in Only Fools and Horses. Never a one-trick pony, he had an award-winning spell as TV's favourite detective Jack Frost, took a country jaunt as Pop Larkin in the Darling Buds of May, and even voiced a crime-fighting cartoon rodent in the much-loved children's show Danger Mouse. But life hasn't all been so easy: from missing out on a key role in Dad's Army to nearly drowning in a freak diving accident, David has had his fair share of ups and downs, and has lost some of his nearest and dearest along the way. David's is a touching, funny and warm-hearted story, which charts the course of his incredible five decades at the top of the entertainment business. He's been a shopkeeper and a detective inspector, a crime-fighter and a market trader, and he ain't finished yet. As Del Boy would say, it's all cushty.

936,The Autobiography of Malcolm X (SparkNotes Literature Guides),"Malcolm X's searing memoir belongs on the small shelf of great autobiographies. The reasons are many: the blistering honesty with which he recounts his transformation from a bitter, self-destructive petty criminal into an articulate political activist, the continued relevance of his militant analysis of white racism, and his emphasis on self-respect and self-help for African Americans. And there's the vividness with which he depicts black popular culture--try as he might to criticize those lindy hops at Boston's Roseland dance hall from the perspective of his Muslim faith, he can't help but make them sound pretty wonderful. These are but a few examples. The Autobiography of Malcolm X limns an archetypal journey from ignorance and despair to knowledge and spiritual awakening. When Malcolm tells coauthor Alex Haley, ""People don't realize how a man's whole life can be changed by one book,"" he voices the central belief underpinning every attempt to set down a personal story as an example for others. Although many believe his ethic was directly opposed to Martin Luther King Jr.'s during the civil rights struggle of the '60s, the two were not so different. Malcolm may have displayed a most un-Christian distaste for loving his enemies, but he understood with King that love of God and love of self are the necessary first steps on the road to freedom. --Wendy Smith",1586638335,9781586638337,72,SparkNotes,Malcolm X,Alex Haley,4.33,3,0,SparkNotes,June 13th 2003,Paperback,English,1832-31066.The_Autobiography_of_Malcolm_X.html

938,A Change of Habit: The Autobiography Of A Former Catholic Nun,"""A Change of Habit"" weaves a tapestry of zeal, rigorous discipline and shattered beliefs of a mature woman who left her vows as a nun to search for spiritual fulfillment. Joanne Howe's narrative brims with emotion, and the richness of her experience will linger long after the book is closed. Joanne Howe is a retired elementary school teacher and a popular speaker at women's retreats. She began preparing to be a Roman Catholic nun at age 13 and later served in the Sisters of St. Joseph for 19 years. During that time, as much as she desired to serve God, she found that the life of a nun did not lead to the fulfillment and spiritual satisfaction she desperately needed. At the end of a long and agonizing process of soul-searching, she came to the conclusion that there had to be a better way for her to serve her Lord. She finally relinquished her vows in 1968 and found complete peace with God four years later.",0892252928,9780892252923,120,Joanne Howe,Lynn Paul Coffman, ,3.33,12,3,Gospel Advocate Company,December 1st 1996,Paperback,English,1834-7243878-a-change-of-habit.html

941,"Did You Grow Up with Me, Too?: The Autobiography of June Foray","""Like millions of people, I've been listening to June Foray for most of my life. I remember when I first encountered Rocky and Bullwinkle in their first season on TV, and falling under the spell of Jay Ward's sharply-written, wonderfully performed cartoons. What I can't remember is when I learned that the same woman who provided the voice of Rocky also acted as Natasha, Nell, and a host of other characters on the series, including the gravely-voiced fairy godmother who was patterned after character actress Marjorie Main. But as a diehard cartoon fan, it didn't take me long to memorize the names of the actors in the show's credits (fleeting though they were). ""Around the same time I became enamored of Stan Freberg's comedy records, including such hit singles as ""St. George and the Dragonet"" and classic albums like Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America. The rich, colorful voices on those records became permanently ingrained in my consciousness, and in time I connected the dots and realized that June, Paul Frees, and Daws Butler were the same people I heard on so many cartoon soundtracks."" - Leonard Maltin, from his Foreword",1593934610,9781593934613,164,June Foray,Mark Evanier,Earl Kress,3.65,17,5,BearManor Media,July 4th 2009,Paperback,English,1837-7042579-did-you-grow-up-with-me-too.html

944,Who On Earth Is Tom Baker? An Autobiography,"One of the great British television phenomena of the 60's and 70's, known to all who are now entering or firmly placed in mid-life, was the advent of Doctor Who . This original and most British of television series chronicled the travels and tribulations of the famous Doctor Who and his merry band of followers. Tom Baker, though not the first but probably the most unforgettable of the actors who took on this role, has published an autobiography that not only lets us explore the man made famous but also the man himself. Tom inhabited the world of television production agencies, the BBC with its cast of thousands, and the drinking haunts of Soho with the likes of Jeffery Bernard, Anthony Hopkins and actors for whom feast and famine were a daily way of life. Tom, with his expressive face and kind eyes was born in Liverpool to a raucous and lively Irish family where love and a good respect for the teachings of the Catholic Church were able to prepare him for an interesting and fulfilling life. In fact, Tom's early experiences with the church involved a trial at a monastery for an unsuccessful preparation as a priest and an insight into the daily workings of these institutions. A slow starting but rapidly improving acting career was followed by time spent pulling pints and on London construction sites before the big break. Then came with the casting agent and the meeting that allowed for instant world-wide recognition for the famous Doctor Who that still exists today. The style of the story is very much that of a black comedy with a marriage, children and a certain fixation with a lawnmower and the mowing of the grass around his own gravestone, making for an enjoyable read. He is now happily married and living in a rural utopia outside of London, millions of miles and light years away from the hectic and all- consuming career of both straight acting and in the television role that has made him famous in more that 70 countries. -- Brian Reinker",0002558343,9780002558341,268,Tom Baker, , ,4.08,412,55,HarperCollins,1997,Hardcover,English,184-828376.Who_On_Earth_Is_Tom_Baker_An_Autobiography.html

In an effort to get rid of this nightmarish female, Eli finds himself fighting for survival in the slums of London, handing out payoffs to crooked cops in Chicago, and finally ending up in the gay-friendly climes of San Francisco during the waning days of the Haight Ashbury drug and free love culture. Though this dark, perverse, funny, erotic, and somewhat insane story is ultimately about Eli's battle for freedom, disparate tales about Crowley Magick, the professional world of chess and backgammon, a vampire attack in San Francisco's golden gate park, UFOs in the Oregon woods, and the wise lessons of a Haight Ashbury holy man paint a picture of a colorful time, not so long ago, that no longer exists.",098992890X,9780989928908,252,Jeremy Silman, , ,4.00,2,0,Maelstrom Press,October 28th 2013,Paperback,English,1844-18731239-autobiography-of-a-goat.html
950,A Child's Autobiography,"This is a story of my early life, growing up in mid to late a70s Scotland, in a Catholic working-class background, in a mainly pre-war council estate, but with still the same hopes and dreams as any child. A lot of happiness stemmed from Christmas, holidays, television, pop music/radio, school, friends, church and hobbies. In particular, primary school was an extension of family. Holidays to Anstruther on the east coast in a caravan, and day trips to zoos, castles, particularly in Edinburgh, and Clyde resorts like Ayr all contributed to happiness. TV, particularly US programmes like Charlieas Angels, Six Million Dollar Man, and Loganas Run all influenced my life, as well as British TV and childrenas novels. Struggles were found with friends at high school, but nonetheless, exam success and enjoying everyday events like prizegivings and concerts as well as getting to know my extended family and joining them for gala days and other family events ensured a happy early adolescence. Religion too, from First Communion to Caring Church Week at school and retreats ensured a happy life under the ethos of the school. There were minor disappointments such as finding I was useless at skiing and most sports, practical things like cooking and sewing and lacking social skills, but I believe I had an upbringing which encouraged values of honesty and integrity against a harsh climate, low income, housing which then lacked amenities, poor health records, pollution and low life expectancy.

Speaking just after the turn of the century - the book was first published in 1911 - the elderly voice rejoices in grandchildren, complains of the constraints that one's children and society place on older people, muses on the approach of infirmity and death and celebrates the motto, ""as soon as you feel too old to do a thing, do it."" But there is mystery behind this voice. Doris Grumbach explains her solution to that mystery in her Afterword: ""Now, what about this cultivated, authentic-sounding, feisty old lady who, it seems, sat down to write anonymously about her life?

971,"Theodore Roosevelt, An Autobiography","• This Kindle edition offers three very different accounts of a remarkable man, former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt including Roosevelt’s 500-page autobiography, two biographies, and the address given to the U.S. Congress by Roosevelt’s confidant Henry Cabot Lodge. About The Authors Theodore ""T.R."" Roosevelt, Jr. Theodore Roosevelt (1858 –1919) was an American politician, author, naturalist, soldier, explorer, and historian who served as the 26th President of the United States. He was a leader of the Republican Party (GOP) and founder of the Progressive Party insurgency of 1912. He is known for his exuberant personality, range of interests and achievements, and his leadership of the Progressive Movement, as well as his ""cowboy"" persona and robust masculinity. Born into a wealthy family in New York City, Roosevelt was a sickly child who suffered from asthma. To overcome his physical weakness, he embraced a strenuous life. He was home-schooled and became an eager student of nature. He attended Harvard College where he studied biology, boxed, and developed an interest in naval affairs. He quickly entered politics, determined to become a member of the ruling class. In 1881 he was elected to the New York State Assembly, where he became a leader of the reform faction of the GOP. His book The Naval War of 1812 (1882) established him as a learned historian and writer. When his first wife Alice died two days after giving birth in February 1884 (and his mother died the same day in the same house), he was heartbroken and in despair; Roosevelt temporarily left politics and became a cattle rancher in the Dakotas. When blizzards destroyed his herd, he returned to New York City politics, running and losing a race for mayor. In the 1890s he took vigorous charge of the city police as New York City Police Commissioner. By 1897, under President William McKinley, Roosevelt was in effect running the Navy Department. When the war with Spain broke out in 1898, he helped form the famous Rough Riders, a combination of wealthy Easterners and Western cowboys. He gained national fame for his courage in battle in Cuba, then returned to be elected Governor of New York. He was the GOP nominee for Vice President with William McKinley, campaigning successfully against radicalism and for prosperity, national honor, imperialism (regarding the Philippines), high tariffs and the gold standard. Roosevelt became President after McKinley was assassinated in 1901. He was inaugurated at age 42, the youngest person to become president. Henry Cabot Lodge (1850 –1924) Henry Cabot Lodge was an American Republican Senator and historian from Massachusetts. A PhD in history from Harvard, he was a long-time friend and confidant of Theodore Roosevelt. Edward L. Stratemeyer (1862 –1930) was an American publisher and writer of children's fiction. He was one of the most prolific writers in the world, producing in excess of 1,300 books himself, selling in excess of 500 million copies. Edmund Lester Pearson Pearson (1880–1937) was an American librarian and author. born in Newburyport, Massachusetts.

In that euphoric moment she symbolised Australia's best and broadest vision of itself, a reconciled nation. For the first time, in her own words, Cathy Freeman tells the story of her remarkable life. With characteristic honesty she talks about growing up black in a white world, about her complicated personal relationships, about how it feels to have the expectations of an entire nation resting on her shoulders, about the price of fame, and about the real reasons for her heart-wrenching decision to retire. Cathy tells us what it's like to be Cathy Freeman. Her strength, courage and magnetic personality are reflected on every page.",1904317774,9781904317777,272,Cathy Freeman,Scott Gullan, ,3.20,5,2,Highdown,July 15th 2004,Paperback,English,1866-6395258-cathy.html
974,"Kickups, Hiccups, Lockups: The Autobiography","Maverick is one of the kinder words uttered about Mickey Thomas, the 'Welsh George Best', during a remarkable football career spanning spells at Wrexham, Manchester United, Chelsea, Everton - and Kirkham Open Prison FC. Mickey's world didn't just revolve around pulling on boots on a Saturday afternoon for club and country. His life was dedicated to pulling birds, pranks and generally getting into scrapes which would make Paul Gascoigne look like a choirboy. But no-one knows about the heart-breaking events in his private life which Mickey has kept secret for twenty years. How he hit rock bottom, and below, and survived as one of the greatest characters the game has ever known. From his early days growing up on a rough council estate, leaving school at 14 without the ability to read and write, through to his spells at the bright lights of Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge, where he became a cult hero for fans who recognised his rogue and unique genius, this is football's ultimate rollercoaster ride story. There are extraordinary highs, and heart-rending lows - none more so than the episode in 1993 when he was jailed for passing counterfeit money to apprentices. Through it all, Mickey has endeared a generation of football fans with his good humour and boundless energy and enthusiasm for the game and life. Mickey's story is the most exciting, enthralling and touching football autobiography of 2008.",1846055237,9781846055232,304,Mickey Thomas, , ,3.29,7,0,Century,September 4th 2008,Hardcover,English,1867-12204993-kickups-hiccups-lockups.html

Some artists claim to reveal the private details of their lives in authentic shows of intimacy; others seek to mask themselves behind invented alter egos or carefully designed images or personae. Some explore the influence of the media or of political and social systems on our sense of who we are, while others explore the impact of one's ethnic or racial background on self-identity. Artists question how identity is formed in a global world and explore the changing role of the individual in modern society, expanding our understanding of what it means to be alive today.

996,Little Masterpieces of Autobiography; Actors,"Excerpt: ...affected either one way or the other by these circumstances, at the same time our calling must benefit in the general level of its excellence, in its fitness to represent all grades of society on the stage, if those who follow it are picked from all classes, if the stage has ceased to be regarded as a calling unfit for a man or woman of breeding or education, The second question this lady asks me is this: ""Does she need to have her voice trained, and about what age do people generally commence to go on the stage?"" The first part of this question as to voice training touches on the value of an Academy of Acting. Of the value-the practical value-of such an institution rightly conducted there can be no doubt. That acting cannot be taught is a well-worn maxim and perhaps a true one; but acting can be disciplined; the ebullient, sometimes eccentric and disordered manifestations of budding talent may be modified by the art of the teacher; those rudiments, which many so often acquire painfully in the course of rehearsal, the pupils who leave an academy should be masters of and so save much time and trouble to those whose business it is to produce plays. The want of any means of training the beginner, of coping at all with the floods of men and women, fit and unfit, who are ever clamouring at the doors of the theatre, has been a long-crying and much-felt grievance. The establishment of this academy should go far to remove what has been by no means an unjust reproach to our theatrical system. As to the age at which a person should begin a theatrical career, I do not think there is any actor or actress who would not say that it is impossible to begin too early-at least, as early as a police magistrate will allow. That art is long and life short applies quite as truthfully to the actor's as to any other art, and as the years go on there must be many who regret that they did not sooner decide to follow a calling which seems to carry one all too quickly...",1153739224,9781153739221,42,George Iles, , ,4.25,4,1,Rarebooksclub.com,August 9th 2012,Paperback,English,1887-9791995-little-masterpieces-of-autobiography-actors.html

He staked out considerable success as an entrepreneur and public voice in the American West before moving on to other frontiers. In California, where he had gone to seek his fortune, he was politically active, protesting the poll tax, editing a newspaper, and generally speaking out. After exile in Canada, necessitated by his civil-rights agitation and the political climate, Gibbs returned to the United States in 1869—to Oberlin, Ohio, where he earned a degree in law. Then he went to Little Rock, Arkansas, serving as a judge until his appointment as U.S. Consul to Madagascar in 1897. Shadow and Light offers many historical sidelights—on the underground railroad young Gibbs knew first hand, the abolition movement, the Spanish-American War, and nineteenth-century race relations.

1000,All In My Head: The Autobiography,"For Tipperary hurling, defeat in the 2012 All-Ireland semi-final was heartbreaking. For Lar Corbett, it was devastating. Then again it has never been a straight road for the three-time All-star and 2010 ‘Player of the Year’. Deemed not good enough to play for Tipperary at minor level, he was nineteen before his unique talent was identified by Nicky English who gave Lar his chance in the All-Ireland winning squad of 2001. But this success was to be followed by years of despair as Tipperary hurling floundered, managers came and went, and a recurring hamstring condition left his career hanging in the balance. The turning point came in 2007 with the arrival of the ‘dream team’ of Liam Sheedy, Eamon O’Shea and Michael Ryan. Encouraged to play more freely and to exploit his explosive pace, Lar soon became one of the most lethal forwards in the game. His three-goal blitz against Kilkenny in the 2010 All Ireland final is the stuff of legend. Following defeat in the 2011 All-Ireland final, Lar stepped away from the game in February 2012 but was ultimately persuaded to return for the championship. Then came the disastrous semi-final where tactical changes kept Lar largely out of the game and provoked unprecedented criticism from media and fans alike. In All In My Head , Lar offers a unique insight into what happened on that day and over the turbulent year leading up to it. This honest and revealing autobiography is a must-read for all fans of the sport of hurling.",1448152216,9781448152216,304,Lar Corbett, , ,3.43,7,2,Transworld Digital,October 25th 2012,ebook, ,1890-17245846-all-in-my-head.html

On his return he worked for the family business, but when World War Two came he lost no time in enlisting.

After the war Dunkelman returned to Canada, but in 1948 he went to war again--this time to fight for the young nation of Israel in the struggle to establish a Jewish state.

1006,Picturing Ourselves: Photography and Autobiography,"Photography has transformed the way we picture ourselves. Although photographs seem to ""prove"" our existence at a given point in time, they also demonstrate the impossibility of framing our multiple and fragmented selves. As Linda Haverty Rugg convincingly shows, photography's double take on self-image mirrors the concerns of autobiographers, who see the self as simultaneously divided (in observing/being) and unified by the autobiographical act. Rugg tracks photography's impact on the formation of self-image through the study of four literary autobiographers concerned with the transformative power of photography. Obsessed with self-image, Mark Twain and August Strindberg both attempted (unsuccessfully) to integrate photographs into their autobiographies. While Twain encouraged photographers, he was wary of fakery and kept a fierce watch on the distribution of his photographic image. Strindberg, believing that photographs had occult power, preferred to photograph himself. Because of their experiences under National Socialism, Walter Benjamin and Christa Wolf feared the dangerously objectifying power of photographs and omitted them from their autobiographical writings. Yet Benjamin used them in his photographic conception of history, which had its testing ground in his often-ignored Berliner Kindheit um 1900 . And Christa Wolf's narrator in Patterns of Childhood attempts to reclaim her childhood from the Nazis by reconstructing mental images of lost family photographs. Confronted with multiple and conflicting images of themselves, all four of these writers are torn between the knowledge that texts, photographs, and indeed selves are haunted by undecidability and the desire for the returned glance of a single self.",0226731472,9780226731476,293,Linda Haverty Rugg, , ,3.25,4,0,University Of Chicago Press,December 8th 1997,Paperback,English,1896-996433.Picturing_Ourselves.html

He did not speak about it at length, but said that he had written me a letter, not to be opened until after his death, containing instructions for publication. This letter was dated 30th April, 1876. I will give here as much of it as concerns the public: ""I wish you to accept as a gift from me, given you now, the accompanying pages which contain a memoir of my life. My intention is that they shall be published after my death, and be edited by you. But I leave it altogether to your discretion whether to publish or to suppress the work;-and also to your discretion whether any part or what part shall be omitted. But I would not wish that anything should be added to the memoir. If you wish to say any word as from yourself, let it be done in the shape of a preface or introductory chapter."" At the end there is a postscript: ""The publication, if made at all, should be effected as soon as possible after my death.""

1012,Journey of Navajo Oshley: An Autobiography and Life History,"Ak'é Nýdzin, or Navajo Oshley, was born sometime between 1879 and 1893. His oral memoir is set on the northern frontier of Navajo land, principally the San Juan River basin in southeastern Utah, and tells the story of his early life near Dennehetso and his travels, before there were roads or many towns, from Monument Valley north along Comb Ridge to Blue Mountain. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Anglos and Navajos expanded their use and settlement of lands north of the San Juan. Grazing lands and the Anglo wage economy drew many Navajos across the river. Oshley, a sheepherder, was among the first to settle there. He cared for the herds of his extended family, while also taking supplemental jobs with the growing livestock industry in the area. His narrative is woven with vivid and detailed portraits of Navajo culture: clan relationships, marriages and children, domestic life, the importance of livestock, complex relations with the natural world, ceremonies, trading, and hand trembling.",087421291X,9780874212914,235,Robert McPherson, , ,4.00,9,0,Utah State University Press,May 1st 2000,Paperback,English,1901-2265945.Journey_of_Navajo_Oshley.html

1014,Autobiographies of Orhan Pamuk: The Writer in His Novels,"""Pamuk is a writer who shares my reverence for the great art of the novel. He takes the novel seriously in a way that is perhaps no longer possible for Western writers, boldly describing it as European civilization’s greatest invention.""—Michael McGaha Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk is a prominent voice in Turkish literature, speaking to the country’s history, culture, and politics. In 2006, he became the first Turkish writer to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature. Autobiographies of Orhan Pamuk is the first book-length study of the life and writings of Pamuk. It provides both a historical and cultural context that will help readers better understand and appreciate both the man and his work. It begins with a brief biography, outlines Pamuk’s contributions to Turkish literature and history, examines how his art has evolved over the past thirty years, and discusses some of the writers who provided inspiration. Though his books deal with specifically Turkish issues, like all great literature the themes they explore are universal. In addition to a thorough analysis of his seven published novels, including Snow and My Name is Red , an entire chapter is devoted to his first two novels, Cevdet Bey and Sons and The Silent House , which have yet to be translated into English. This is a comprehensive examination of the Nobel laureate’s work, free of jargon and of interest to anyone who enjoys good literature.",0874809304,9780874809305,213,Michael McGaha, , ,4.50,2,0,University of Utah Press,June 6th 2008,Hardcover,English,1903-2496112.Autobiographies_of_Orhan_Pamuk.html
1015,David Weir: Extra Time: My Autobiography,"David Weir had a lot to celebrate in 2010: a second successive Scottish Premier League title as captain of Rangers, and his 40th birthday. Weir's is a tale of triumph on the pitch but also victory, in a wider sense, over the idea that all top-level footballers are finished in their mid-30s. In the course of captaining Rangers to their success in 2009-10, Weir became the oldest outfield player to represent the club since 1945. In this autobiography, Weir explains in detail why he stopped playing for Scotland under Berti Vogts and later returned when Walter Smith was appointed—for the first time, he gives his side of story. He gives an insight into the high of playing in the 1998 World Cup finals for his country, their last appearance on the game's greatest stage, to the low of the chaotic 2-2 draw in the Faroe Isles four years later. Like thousands of footballers before him, he could just have accepted his time was up and headed the golf course. He had a young family and a father who was suffering from Alzheimer's to help care for. Rather than give up, he moved from Everton to Rangers in 2007, making his debut for his childhood favorites at a mere 36 years and 236 days. Since then, Weir has helped them to six trophies and a European final in 2008. Weir's is a story of battling against the odds, a determination to keep playing at the top level and proving he could, despite the doubts of others and, indeed, himself.",1444724223,9781444724226,352,David Weir, , ,3.36,14,1,Hodder & Stoughton,October 1st 2012,Paperback,English,1904-13230110-david-weir.html
1016,The Pages of My Life: Autobiography and Selected Stories,"Popati Hiranandani's (1924-2007) autobiograpy unfolds the experiences of her personal life trapped in the geo-political debris of pre- and post-Partition India. She traces the agony and ecstasy of her life, the critical junctures of becoming and unbecoming in the life of a Sindhi woman-the two phases of her pre-Partition and post-Partition life are fused by the inconsolable and unmitigated trauma triggered by the loss of home. Through an exegesis of gender relations in colonial and postcolonial India and scrutiny of personal experiences and memories, Hiranandani offers her understanding of the real obstacles that come in women's ways of wielding autonomy over their lives. Hiranandani's short stories posit a fictional account of multifaceted existence of womanhood. Caught in the web of nostalgia, agony, pain of separation, and reunion-both imaginary and real-Hiranandani's protagonists attempt to veil their tears and recount the stories of the lives that remained untold and unheard for a long time. Translated, and with an Introduction, by Jyoti Panjwani, this work traces the migration of the Sindhi community in pre- and post-Partition India. The detailed analysis of the development of Sindhi literature is accompanied by Panjwani's re-contextualizing of Hiranandani's life and work in present-day India.",0198066945,9780198066941,179,Popati Hiranandani,Jyoti Panjwani, ,4.60,5,1,Oxford University Pres,January 1st 2011,Hardcover,English,1905-9571977-the-pages-of-my-life.html

1021,Never Die Easy: The Autobiography of Walter Payton,"""Never die easy. Why run out of bounds and die easy? Make that linebacker pay. It carries into all facets of your life. It's okay to lose, to die, but don't die without trying, without giving it your best."" His legacy is towering. Walter Payton—the man they called Sweetness, for the way he ran—remains the most prolific running back in the history of the National Football League, the star of the Chicago Bears' only Super Bowl Championship, eleven times voted the most popular sports figure in Chicago's history. Off the field, he was a devoted father whose charitable foundation benefited tens of thousands of children each year, and who—faced with terminal liver disease—refused to use his celebrity to gain a preferential position for organ donation. Walter Payton was not just a football hero; he was America's hero. Never Die Easy is Walter Payton's autobiography, told from the heart. Growing up poor in Mississippi, he took up football to get girls' attention, and went on to become a Black College All-American at tiny Jackson State (during which time he was also a finalist in a Soul Train dance contest). Drafted by the Bears in 1975, he predicted that he would last only five years but went on to play thirteen extraordinary seasons, a career earning him regular acknowledgment as one of the greatest players in the history of professional football. And when his playing days were over, he approached business and charity endeavors with the same determination and success he had brought to the football field, always putting first his devotion to friends and family. His ultimate battle with illness truly proved him the champion he always had been and prompted a staggering outpouring of love and support from hundreds of thousands of friends and admirers. Written with veteran journalist and author Don Yaeger in the last weeks of Walter Payton's life, Never Die Easy presents Walter's singular voice—warm, plainspoken, funny, self-aware—along with the voices of the friends, family, teammates, and business associates who knew him best at all stages of his life, including his wife, Connie, and their children, Brittney and Jarrett; his teammate and friend Matt Suhey; former Bears head coach Mike Ditka; and many, many others. Walter made Don Yaeger promise that his book would be ""inspirational and leave people with some kind of lesson . . . and make sure you spell all the words right."" Never Die Easy keeps all those promises.",0375758216,9780375758218,288,Walter Payton,Don Yaeger, ,4.22,754,77,Random House Trade Paperbacks,September 11th 2001,Paperback,English,191-6837.Never_Die_Easy.html

1028,The Act of Life of Amrish Puri: An Autobiography,"The trademark hat, booming rich baritone, intent smouldering eyes, a towering height, and an imposing presence -only a dramatic description would possibly delineate this versatile painter of sinister strokes, who left a tremendous, hypnotic impact on Indian cinema. Amrish Puri, whose voice could send shivers down your spine, while his antics made you chuckle; his costumes could drive you nuts, and his one-liners ranging from Mogambo khush hua to Dong kabhi wrong nahin hota become household parlance. The industry's ace villain was credited with bringing the hitherto mundane villainy into strobe light, and lent it a pride of place on the billboard with his unmatched histrionics. This son of the soil, born in the heart of Punjab in Naushahr, spent his formative years in the hilly regions and trekked miles in the valley of Simla, the summer capital of British India. He followed his creative instincts in college rather surreptitiously, given the stern scrutiny of a conservative, authoritarian father. Moved to the tinsel town of Bombay in the early 1950s, where his elder siblings Chaman and Madan Puri were already groping in the glamour world and he had to write his own destiny. After initial heartbreaks, dejected as a hero aspirant, he turned to theatre and created an amazing repertoire essaying some of the most challenging roles under the aegis of stalwarts, like Ebrahim Alkazi, Satyadev Dubey, Vijay Tendulkar, Girish Kamad, Badal Sircar and Mohan Rakesh, among others. But pursuing this innate passion for stage didn't provide for livelihood; bread and butter came from the rigmarole of a clerical job in a government office. And recording advertisement jingles and radio plays extended a little icing on the cake. The providential break on the silver screen came at an age when lesser mortals would be resolving mid-career crisis. And once again, he made a distinct mark in offbeat, parallel cinema of Shyam Benegal and Govind Nihalani, as he subtly transplanted the stark profundity of theatre on to celluloid. But the real litmus test was the commercial viability of his talent, as he could also rake in revenue at the box-office. Here too, he graduated with stunning performances, and became the highest paid villain breathing life into characters as the bald baddie, the cold-blooded don, the ruthless politician, the lecherous viper. The machiavellian prince evoked the essence of evil and went on to build a treasure of excellence, whether he played a wily father or an affectionate patriarch. This star-actor became a reckoning force in both Hindi and regional films with over 300 titles in his kitty. His brilliant renditions elicited the attention of renowned Hollywood director Steven Spielberg, thus emerging on the international horizon. The book captures poignant moments in the life of a terrific performer with the class act of a chameleon, who depicted an era that encountered the most challenging facet of blending art and commerce, seeking triumph over the paradox of playing the negative and positive, to create cinematic history.

Schweitzer is celebrated around the world as a European pioneer of medical service in Africa, a groundbreaking philosopher & musical scholar, & a catalyst of environmental & peace activism. Yet people most revere him for his dedication to serving others & his profound & influential ethic of reverence for life. For him, reverence for life was not a theory or a philosophy but a discovery--a recognition that the capacity to experience & act on a reverence for all life is a fundamental part of human nature, a characteristic that sets human beings apart from the rest of the natural world. This anniversary edition coincides with several high profile celebrations of his 1949 visit, as well as the release of a new feature film starring Jeroen Krabbe & Barbara Hershey.

1033,The Red Parts: Autobiography of a Trial,"Late in 2004, Maggie Nelson was looking forward to the publication of her book Jane: A Murder , a narrative in verse about the life and death of her aunt, who had been murdered thirty-five years before. The case remained unsolved, but Jane was assumed to have been the victim of an infamous serial killer in Michigan in 1969. Then, one November afternoon, Nelson received a call from her mother, who announced that the case had been reopened; a new suspect would be arrested and tried on the basis of a DNA match. Over the months that followed, Nelson found herself attending the trial with her mother and reflecting anew on the aura of dread and fear that hung over her family and childhood--an aura that derived not only from the terrible facts of her aunt's murder but also from her own complicated journey through sisterhood, daughterhood, and girlhood. The Red Parts is a memoir, an account of a trial, and a provocative essay that interrogates the American obsession with violence and missing white women, and that scrupulously explores the nature of grief, justice, and empathy.",1555977367,9781555977368,224,Maggie Nelson, , ,4.04,263,29, , ,Paperback, ,1920-25664464-the-red-parts.html

""That halcyon period started about 1910 and it was in full flower after WW I when I was a young man; it died with WW II when airplanes had grown too costly and too compli- cated for individuals to build or even to operate. I count myself lucky that that fleeting period coincided with my youth and my young manhood, and that I had a part in it.""",1889439185,9781889439181,268,Nevil Shute, , ,3.87,263,26,Paper Tiger (NJ),December 19th 1954,Hardcover,English,1922-557154.Slide_Rule.html

1037,Fictions in Autobiography: Studies in the Art of Self-Invention,"Investigating autobiographical writing of Mary McCarthy, Henry James, Jean-Paul Sartre, Saul Friedlander, and Maxine Hong Kingston, this book argues that autobiographical truth is not a fixed but an evolving content in a process of self-creation. Further, Paul John Eakin contends, the self at the center of all autobiography is necessarily fictive. Professor Eakin shows that the autobiographical impulse is simply a special form of reflexive consciousness: from a developmental viewpoint, the autobiographical act is a mode of self-invention always practiced first in living and only eventually, and occasionally, in writing.

1039,Open Secret: The Autobiography of the Former Director-General of MI5,"Rimington's account of her rise in what was very definitely a man's world.. Stella Rimington was educated at Nottingham Girls' High School, and Edinburgh and Liverpool Universities. In 1959 she started work in the Worcestershire County Archives, moving in 1962 to the India Office Library in London, as Assistant Keeper responsible for manuscripts relating to the period of the British rule in India. In 1965 she joined the Security Service (MI5) part-time, while she was in India accompanying her husband on a posting to the British High Commission in New Delhi. On her return to the UK she joined MI5 as a full-time employee. During her career in MI5, which lasted from 1969 to 1996, Stella Rimington worked in all the main fields of the Service's responsibilities - counter-subversion, counter-espionage and counter-terrorism - and became successively Director of all three branches.

1046,His Glassy Essence: An Autobiography Of Charles Sanders Peirce,"Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914), the most important and influential of the classical American philosophers, is credited as the inventor of the philosophical school of pragmatism. The scope and significance of his work have had a lasting effect not only in several fields of philosophy but also in mathematics, the history and philosophy of science, and the theory of signs, as well as in literary and cultural studies. Inspired by his friendship and correspondence with the novelist Walker Percy, who himself was absorbed by the life and writings of Peirce, Ketner adopts a narrative strategy that lets Peirce tell his own early life story. He weaves the voluminous components of an intellectual biography that are scattered throughout Peirce's published and unpublished writings into a novelistic account that reads like a mystery. Ketner offers satisfying explanations and convincing hypotheses for a number of intimate and controversial aspects of Peirce's eventful yet frustrated life, including his inability to find a permanent teaching position at any university, the ancestry of Peirce's wife Juliette and the source of his family's hostility toward her, and the previously unknown fact that Peirce actually had three wives instead of two.",0826513131,9780826513137,416,Charles Sanders Peirce,Kenneth Laine Ketner, ,3.78,9,0,Vanderbilt University Press,August 15th 1998,Hardcover,English,1932-866095.His_Glassy_Essence.html

1049,As If: An Autobiography,"As If: An Autobiography traces the complex life and career of director, scholar, and theorist Herbert Blau, one of the most innovative voices in the American theater. From his earliest years on the streets of Brooklyn, with gang wars there, to the often embattled, now-legendary Actor's Workshop of San Francisco, the powerfully told story of Blau's first four decades is also a social history, moving from the Great Depression to the cold war, with fallout from ""the balance of terror"" on what he once described in an incendiary manifesto as The Impossible Theater. Blau has always forged his own path, from his activist resistance to the McCarthy witch hunts to his emergence as a revolutionary director whose work included the controversial years at The Workshop, which introduced American audiences to major playwrights of the European avant-garde, including Brecht, Beckett, Genet, and Pinter. There is also an account here of that notorious production of Waiting for Godot at the maximum-security prison at San Quentin, which became the insignia of the Theater of the Absurd. Blau went on from The Workshop to become codirector of the Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center, and then founding provost of California Institute of the Arts, where he developed and became artistic director of the experimental group KRAKEN. Currently Byron W. and Alice L. Lockwood Professor of the Humanities at the University of Washington, Blau has been visionary in the passage from theater to theory, and his many influential and award-winning books include The Dubious Spectacle: Extremities of Theater, 1976–2000; Sails of the Herring Fleet: Essays on Beckett; Nothing in Itself: Complexions of Fashion; To All Appearances: Ideology and Performance; The Audience; The Eye of Prey: Subversions of the Postmodern; and Take Up the Bodies: Theater at the Vanishing Point.

This was shown both in the Lions tour of Australia in 2001 and in England's 2003 World Cup campaign. In his autobiography, he looks back across his hugely successful career as one of the last players in the game who has known both the amateur and professional eras. He provides revealing portraits of his team-mates and opponents, as well as explaining the keys to England's triumphs. He also discusses his frustration at the injuries that have blighted his career over the last two years. Hugely admired by rugby fans for his no-nonsense attitude to the game, only Martin Johnson in the recent era has earned such respect from fans and opponents alike.",140910611X,9781409106111,320,Richard Hill, , ,0.00,0,0,Orion,December 29th 2010,ebook,English,1936-14325417-the-autobiography.html

1065,The Autobiography of God,"Rebecca Nachman is a Rabbi without a synagogue. Having resigned from her dwindling congregation, she now works as a college counselor at a small Vermont college advising students about private matters and offering the ""Jewish perspective"" on issues raised at faculty dinner parties. Deeply lonely and on the edge of losing her faith, she comes into possession of a Torah, the last relic of Czechowa, a village of Polish Jews who were exterminated by the Nazis. With the Torah, the unquiet spirits of the village dead begin to visit Rebecca. On one visit they leave a manuscript written in Hebrew and titled My Life, an autobiography by God who, like any eager author, is seeking a sympathetic reader. No one has ever finished reading the manuscript, including Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther, Maimonides, and Augustine. God thinks Rebecca will. Rebecca's life is further complicated when one of her advisees-a troubled young woman who seemed on the verge of confessing something-is found murdered. As the college struggles to comprehend the tragedy and a police investigation is launched, Rebecca begins reading, and so comes to confront the central challenge to her faith in His most troubling and unlikely incarnation. Julius Lester's first adult novel in more than a decade, The Autobiography of God marks the return of an utterly original and provocative voice in American letters, addressing religion with wicked humor and profound reverence.",0312348487,9780312348489,256,Julius Lester, , ,3.70,172,42,St. Martin's Griffin,December 27th 2005,Paperback,English,195-101773.The_Autobiography_of_God.html

Unlike the others, however, he recorded his personal and political experiences (up to the even of the 1905 Revolution) in an autobiography. First published in the Soviet Union in the 1920s, this memoir gives us the richest and most thoughtful firsthand account we have of life among the urban lower classes in Imperial Russia. We follow this shy but determined peasant youth's painful metamorphosis into a self-educated, skilled patternmaker, his politicization in the factories and workers' circles of Moscow and St. Petersburg, and his close but troubled relations with members of the liberal and radical intelligentsia. Kanatchikov was an exceptionally sensitive and honest observer, and we learn much from his memoirs about the day-to-day life of villagers and urban workers, including such personal matters as religious beliefs, family tensions, and male-female relationships. We also learn about conditions in the Russian prisons, exile life in the Russian Far North, and the Bolshevik-Menshevik split as seen from the workers' point of view.",0804713316,9780804713313,508,Reginald E.

1087,Autobiography (Autobiography #1-3),"Maxim Gorky, like Leo Tolstoy, was primarily an autobiographical author. The material here is considered amongst his greatest. Not only do they give the astonishingly varied life of Gorky from childhood thru youth, they also provide a picture of one of the most crucial generations in Russian life & history--the late 19th & early 20th centuries. The autobiography begins at age five & ends with Gorky secure in his position as a leading Russian writer. From the beginning, the story is organized as a quest for knowledge & understanding, of oneself & the world one lives in. This quest brings him into contact with the harsh realities of life in late 19th century Russia--the life that was to constitute his 'university'. We follow as he turns from one job to another in an effort to make a living--rag picker, errand & stockboy, junior clerk, bird catcher, cabin boy on a Volga steamer, icon factory apprentice, baker, watchman & rail freight handler. We move with him in his life of wandering from one part of Russia to the next, &, in the course of the journey, we meet some of the most extraordinary characters in literature. The people that crowd the pages of his life history are as interesting as they are varied. Peasants, artisans, scholars, writers, teachers, policemen, government officials--they passed in & out of his strange, sad life, leaving each one of them a vivid imprint on his keen mind. Thru them he learned to build for himself a philosophy of life, & with the memory of them he painted for us those stark, vital pictures which make the unforgettable character of his book. Each character is sharply individualized, mountingly alive, fascinating. There's his grandmother with her strength, her idealism, her superstition, her sympathy. Herself a folk bard, she passed on to him the impulse to hearten others & a rich store of folk song & story. There's Smoury, the chef of the Volga steamer, whom Gorky was later to call one of his outstanding teachers. There's also Olga, the woman with whom Gorky had his 1st love affair; eccentric, irresponsible, flirtatious, but charming & kind. In his portrait of these & other fascinating characters, he's given his greatest--& one of the greatest life stories in literature.",0806501995,9780806501994,624,Maxim Gorky,Isidor Schneider, ,4.45,53,4,Citadel Press (NY),1969,Paperback,English,197-1658337.Autobiography.html

After being baptized around September 1, 1830 by Oliver Cowdery, he was soon called on a mission by the prophet Joseph Smith. This was the first of many such missions that Pratt served. He was a member of Zion’s Camp and served as a missionary in Canada, the southern United States, and the United Kingdom. This book gives his history in his own words.

1095,Close to My Heart: An Autobiography,"This is the autobiography of a quiet woman whose exceptional social conscience and actions are an example of the influence one person can have on society without being either rich or in a lofty political position. As a young woman, Dorothy Sterling's concern for working people in America led her to the Communist Party in the 1930's, a refuge for many with noble intentions. In the 1950s, her concern for the plight of African Americans led her to help integrate her own community of Rye, New York. She went on to become one of the most prolific authors of works of African American history, first for young readers with books such as Mary Jane, the first book about a young black girl growing up in the South. Later works for adults were equally important and influential, including a documentary book on black women's lives which would become a play performed throughout the country and a life of Abolitionist Abby Kelly. Sterling's fascination and concern for the environment led her to write a wonderful natural history guide to Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, Long Island, and the islands in between. Still active at 90, her most recent triumph was to open her own road to oystermen, whose access to local salt flats had been denied by wealthy summer residents.",1593720041,9781593720049,320,Dorothy Sterling, , ,5.00,2,1,Quantuck Lane Press,February 1st 2005,Hardcover,English,1977-942971.Close_to_My_Heart.html

This is the story of my life in rock and roll -- and how the band that has meant everything to me came to define me. I'm looking forward to sharing it with you."" Mick Fleetwood has been a member of the ever-evolving Fleetwood Mac, one of the world's most successful and adored bands, for over four decades.

In this intimate portrait of a life lived in music, Fleetwood vividly recalls his upbringing tapping along to every song playing on the radio, his experiences as a musician in '60s London, and the earliest permutation of the band featuring Peter Green. Play On sheds new light on Fleetwood Mac's raucous history, describing the highs and lows of being in the band that Fleetwood was determined to keep together. Here he reflects on the creation of landmark albums such as Rumours and Tusk, the great loves of his life, and the many incredible and outrageous moments of recording, touring, and living with Fleetwood Mac. Fleetwood describes these moments with honesty and immediacy, taking us to the very heart of this multilayered journey that has always been anchored in music.

1118,Theme and Variations: An Autobiography,"A sincere, professional life story in which the German conductor, at 70, tells of his career in terms of his musical transformations and developments, from his early on to his mature experiences. From a modest, reformed Jewish family of Berlin, his early musical inclinations were sympathetically catered to by his family. At 15, he gave up formal education to devote himself to his career as a pianist, but conducting proved to be his real ambition, and his first engagement, at 17, was in Cologne. There, as coach and chorus master, he found sureness in his ability. Friendship and admiration for Mahler was a determining factor in his advance, and European experiences gave him an international reputation, so that he spent 12 years in Vienna, 10 in Munich. The revolutions in Germany brought him to slow awareness of political upheaval, but his optimism kept him from realizing how much he would be effected. He know the U.S. in the '20's, and found warm audiences here. The Hitlerian persecution roused him to his danger, and via Switzerland he reached America, to stay permanently. Throughout the record are names famous in music, events important in European history, and a vast wealth of artistic detail...

A small-town girl who conquers the Big City on her own terms . . . a sucker for happy endings with an attraction to all things fattening—and a personality that oddly gets her in (and out of) trouble at lightning speed. This is her story . . . and perhaps a little of yours, too. True, Vivian Livingston has the gig of a lifetime, starring 24/7 as the heroine of www.Vivianlives.com , a kind of “girls rule” Web site. But it wasn’t always that way. So rewind, back to the traditionally traumatic last semester of college, when Vivian, feeling the need for drastic change, randomly enters a songwriting contest and, to everyone’s surprise, actually wins. The prize—an incredible weekend getaway to the capital of the universe: New York City. One amazing weekend getaway later, without a real “life” plan and weeks away from graduation, she and her best friend Sophie make the obvious decision . . . NYC here we come! But the moment Vivian and Sophie set foot in their new apartment—a raw, hand-me-down, fourth-floor walk-up studio—they know that life in the Big Apple is going to be anything but easy. Lacking both dough and direction, Vivian has a rough time with the transition. Even worse, Sophie seems to have found a soul mate—and has left Vivian behind. But Vivian is determined to make her world work, despite a few challenging bumps in the road. Rather than ship out, things begin to shape up, as Vivian not only gets the (virtual) keys to the city, but most important, discovers the keys to her own heart.

The thirty narratives included here cover a range of tribes and cultural areas, over a span of more than 200 years. From the earliest known written memoir—a 1768 narrative by the Reverend Samson Occom, a Mohegan, reproduced as a chapter here—to recent reminiscences by such prominent writers as N. Scott Momaday and Gerald Vizenor, the book covers a broad range of Native American experience. The sections include “Traditional Lives;” “The Christian Indians, from the Eighteenth Century to Indian Removal, 1830;” “The Resisting Indians, from Indian Removal to Wounded Knee, 1830-90;” “The Closed Frontier, 1890-;” “The Anthropologists' Indians, 1900-;” “‘Native American Renaissance,’ 1968-;” and “Traditional Lives Today.” Editor Arnold Krupat provides a general introduction, a historical introduction to each of the seven sections, extensive headnotes for each selection, and suggestions for further reading, making this an ideal resource for courses in American literature, history, anthropology, and Native American studies. General readers, too, will find a wealth of fascinating material in the life stories of these Native American men and women.

1125,The Story of Rose O'Neill: An Autobiography,"To most of us, Rose O'Neill is best known as the creator of the Kewpie doll, perhaps the most widely known character in American culture until Mickey Mouse. Prior to O'Neill's success as a doll designer, however, she already had earned a reputation as one of the best-known female commercial illustrators. Her numerous illustrations appeared in America's leading periodicals, including Life, Harper's Bazaar, and Cosmopolitan. While highly successful in the commercial world, Rose O'Neill was also known among intellectuals and artists for her contributions to the fine arts and humanities. In the early 1920s, her more serious works of art were exhibited in galleries in Paris and New York City. In addition, she published a book of poetry and four novels. Yet, who was Rose Cecil O'Neill? Over the course of the twentieth century, Rose O'Neill has captured the attention of journalists, collectors, fans, and scholars who have disagreed over whether she was a sentimentalist or a cultural critic. Although biographers of Rose O'Neill have drawn heavily on portions of her previously unpublished autobiography, O'Neill's own voice--richly revealed in her well-written manuscript--has remained largely unheard until now. In these memoirs, O'Neill reveals herself as a woman who preferred art, activism, and adventure to motherhood and marriage. Featuring photographs from the O'Neill family collection, The Story of Rose O'Neill fully reveals the ways in which she pushed at the boundaries of her generation's definitions of gender in an effort to create new liberating forms.",0826211062,9780826211064,168,Miriam Formanek-Brunell,Miriam Formanek-Brunell, ,4.00,1,0,University of Missouri,May 15th 1997,Hardcover,English,2004-561634.The_Story_of_Rose_O_Neill.html

1127,Joe Royle The Autobiography,"FOREWORD BY SIR ALEX FERGUSON Joe Royle became the youngest player to play for Everton in February 1966 and went on to win six caps under Alf Ramsey and Don Revie. Injury forced a premature end to his career at 32, after spells with Manchester City, Bristol City, and Norwich. Then he became the manager who fell of the back of a lorry when joining Oldham in 1982. Fourteen fantastic, fairytale years followed at the hard-up, homespun Lancashire club which Royle put on the soccer map. Oldham achieved the impossible by going to Wembley and spending three years in the Premiership. Then, it was off to Everton, to Manchester City, and to Ipswich as manager. With a foreword by Sir Alex Ferguson, this book is an honest account of Joe's career and life, written with his full cooperation.",0563488956,9780563488958,256,Joe Royle, , ,3.67,6,1,BBC Books,September 29th 2005,Hardcover,English,2006-7270216-joe-royle-the-autobiography.html
1128,Autobiography of Protest in Hawai'i,"Autobiography of Protest in Hawai'i explores Hawai'i's social and economic fabric through the comments of thirty-five progressive activists. The activists range in age from the mid-thirties to the late seventies and comment on their involvement in issues such as housing, labor, land use, poverty, environment, sexual harassment, seniors, and sovereignty. Almost one-half are women and there is an even split between those born in Hawai'i and those born elsewhere. Their work identity includes professor, lawyer, physician, labor leader, politician, university regent, agency administrator, service industry worker, homemaker, and unemployed. The book begins with an overview of political activism in Hawai'i, and then records the oral history of the thirty-five activists. Each was asked to respond to factors that shaped their moral and political lives. They were invited to explore the forces and events in their past that led them to take on an activist role: family, religion, employment, and other life-shaping experiences, along with external events or movements that were influential in their development. The activists were also asked to provide personal assessments of insights gained from their activist role experiences and how they can be applied today, their analysis of Hawai'i today and some speculation on Hawai'i's future. The result is a book that produces some very interesting and controversial viewpoints on Hawai'i's political socialization and history, as well as personal dynamics, family relations, economic trends, and quality of life.",0824817842,9780824817848,450,Robert H.

1131,Mack the Life: The Autobiography,"A brilliant, heartfelt and hilarious insight into the life of one of our most popular comedians. Lee Mack is not just another comedian with a book. He is one of the UK's most recognisable and celebrated stand-ups. His energy, finely crafted one-liners, and lightning quick ad-libs are second to none, and his solo tours sell out wherever he plays. Autumn 2006 saw the successful launch of Lee's own sitcom Not Going Out on BBC 1 with the first series winning both the Break-Through Award at the RTS Awards and the Gold Rose D'or award for Best Sitcom. This hugely popular show is now on its fifth series with a 6th series scheduled for filming this autumn. It's regularly watched by over 4 million viewers. So what's the story? Lee's early life after leaving school involved time working in a bingo hall and as a stableboy. After working at the stable for three days he asked if he could try and ride a horse; the trainer, Ginger McCain, agreed and the first horse he ever rode was Red Rum. Lee went on to have various other jobs (including a Bluecoat at Pontins and a dog whisperer), and did his first open mike slot in 1994. So far so good. But as anyone who's seen Lee's stand-up will attest, Lee is a natural story teller. He is widely loved and his book will be an absolute corker. And you can bet your bottom dollar that it will be at the very top of Xmas present wishlists up and down the country this autumn.",0593069420,9780593069424,320,Lee Mack, , ,3.68,269,42,Transworld Publishers,October 26th 2012,Hardcover,English,201-13536614-mack-the-life.html
1132,Three Kilos of Coffee: An Autobiography,"In 1948, at the age of fifteen, Manu Dibango left Africa for France, bearing three kilos of coffee for his adopted family and little else. This book chronicles Manu Dibango's remarkable rise from his birth in Douala, Cameroon, to his worldwide success—with Soul Makossa in 1972—as the first African musician ever to record a top 40s hit. Composer, producer, performer, film score writer and humanitarian for the poor, Manu Dibango defines the ""African sound"" of modern world music. He has worked with and influenced such artists as Art Blakey, Don Cherry, Herbie Hancock, Harry Belafonte, Paul Simon, and Johnny Clegg. In Africa, he has helped younger musicians, performed benefit concerts, and transcribed for the first time the scores and lyrics of African musicians. The product of a ""mixed marriage"" (of different tribes and religions) who owes allegiances to both Africa and Europe, Dibango has always been aware of the ambiguities of his identity. This awareness has informed all of the important events of his life, from his marriage to a white Frenchwoman in 1957, to his creation of an ""Afro-music"" which joyfully blends blues, jazz, reggae, traditional European and African serenades, highlife, Caribbean and Arabic music. This music addresses the meaning of ""Africanness"" and what it means to be a Black artist and citizen of the world. This lively and thoughtful memoir is based on an extensive set of interviews in 1989 with French journalist Danielle Rouard. Richly illustrated with photographs, this book will be a must for readers of jazz biographies, students of African music and ethnomusicology, and all those who are lovers of Manu Dibango's unique artistry and accomplishments.",0226144909,9780226144900,158,Manu Dibango,Danielle Rouard,Beth G.

1136,Out of My Life and Thought: An Autobiography,"Published to commemorate Albert Schweitzer’s only visit to the United States 60 years ago, this anniversary edition of his autobiography gives 21st-century readers a unique and authoritative account of the man John F. Kennedy called ""one of the transcendent moral influences of our century."" Schweitzer is celebrated around the world as a European pioneer of medical service in Africa, a groundbreaking philosopher and musical scholar, and a catalyst of environmental and peace activism. Yet people most revere Schweitzer for his dedication to serving others and his profound and influential ethic of reverence for life. For Schweitzer, reverence for life was not a theory or a philosophy but a discovery—a recognition that the capacity to experience and act on a reverence for all life is a fundamental part of human nature, a characteristic that sets human beings apart from the rest of the natural world. This anniversary edition coincides with several high profile celebrations of his 1949 visit, as well as the release of a new feature film starring Jeroen Krabbe and Barbara Hershey. In addition to a foreword by Nobel Laureate and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, this edition features a new foreword by Lachlan Forrow, president of The Albert Schweitzer Fellowship. --This text refers to the Paperback edition.",, ,296,Albert Schweitzer, , ,4.50,6,0,Henry Holt and Co.,October 7th 2014,Kindle Edition,English,2014-24046719-out-of-my-life-and-thought.html

1139,A Call to Assembly : The Autobiography of a Musical Storyteller,"Music came to Willie ruff early in his Alabama boyhood. It came from Mrs. Nance, the solo bass drummer of the Sanctified church, whose beat ""gave her right arm the churning motion of a set of steam locomotive wheels."" It came from singing at the grocery store for candy, and from the ""chitlin struts: at his home, with young Willie sprinkling cornmeal on the floor to make ""gliding"" easy for dancing. It came from eavesdropping on the porch ladies, listening to the rhythm of their revelations. It came from the Sheffield School for Colored the day the second grader met a storied Alabama neighbor, W.C. Handy, who played his St. Louis Blues on the trumpet and spoke to the children about ""the music of the Negro race."" Music and learning (""Can't nobody take nothin from outta your head,"" said his first mentor, Daddy Long) set the course of Willie Ruff's life. He sopped up music and learning when he joined the army at age fourteen, coming under the influence of various fatherly music masters. While he was an undergraduate at Yale, it was Paul Hindemith's magnetic presence that expanded Willie's musical horizons. Later, playing the French horn with the Lionel Hampton band and forming the ""Duo"" with his old piano-playing army sidekick, Dwike Mitchell, Willie learned firsthand from powerful influence like Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Max Roach, Dizzy Gillespie. And through his years at Yale as a professor of music, the quest for learning never stopped. But music wasn't all. A powerfully recurring theme of A Call to Assembly comes from Willie's curiosity about the black soldier in American history. It began when he was in grade school and witnessed an air show by an all-black squadron of fighter pilots from Tuskegee. Later, in the army, Willie met some of those pilots who had fought over Germany and Italy and risked courts-martial to gain the same rights white officers enjoyed. Years later, through a set of extraordinary circumstances, he came across a statement written in 1902 by another Alabama neighbor, an ex-Confederate general who commended the valor of Negro soldiers fighting in the Spanish-American War. It was, Willie writes, as if this general ""laid a hand on me from the grave and gave me pride and understanding."" Willie Ruff's is an exhilarating story, told in a distinctive voice that rings clear and true, smart and funny, and is always moving.",0670838004,9780670838004,432,Willie Ruff, , ,4.56,9,1,Viking Penguin,July 24th 1991,Hardcover, ,2017-4108034-a-call-to-assembly.html

1142,Glow: The Autobiography of Rick James,"Best known for his song “Super Freak,” hitmaker, singer, innovator, producer, award-winning pioneer in the fusion of funk groove and rock, the late Rick James collaborated with music biographer David Ritz in this posthumously published, wildly entertaining, and profound expression of a rock star’s life and soul. He was the nephew of Temptations singer Melvin Franklin; a boy who watched and listened, mesmerized from underneath cocktail tables at the shows of Etta James and Miles Davis. He was a vagrant hippie who wandered to Toronto, where he ended up playing with Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, and he became a household name in the 1980s with his hit song “Super Freak.” Later in life, he was a bad boy who got caught up in drug smuggling and ended up in prison. But since his passing in August 2004, Rick James has remained a legendary icon whose name is nearly synonymous with funk music—and who popularized the genre, creating a lasting influence on pop artists from Prince to Jay-Z to Snoop Dogg, among countless others. In Glow , Rick James and acclaimed music biographer David Ritz collaborated to write a no-holds-barred memoir about the boy and the man who became a music superstar in America’s disco age. It tells of James’s upbringing and how his mother introduced him to musical geniuses of the time. And it reveals details on many universally revered artists, from Marvin Gaye and Prince to Nash, Teena Marie, and Berry Gordy. James himself said, “My journey has taken me through hell and back. It’s all in my music—the parties, the pain, the oversized ego, the insane obsessions.” But despite his bad boy behavior, James was a tremendous talent and a unique, unforgettable human being. His “glow” was an overriding quality that one of his mentors saw in him—and one that will stay with this legendary figure who left an indelible mark on American popular music.",147676414X,9781476764146,342,Rick  James,David Ritz, ,3.84,132,30,Atria Books,July 8th 2014,Hardcover, ,202-18775260-glow.html
1143,Freezing Time: The Autobiography of Eadweard Muybridge,"Soon to be a major motion picture, this action-filled adventure of four fascinating people during one of the most thrilling chapters of American history: the late 19th century transition from the Wild West to the Age of Technology. There’s the narrator of our story, Eadweard Muybridge, the eccentric and mysterious photographer who conquers staggering obstacles to produce the first motion pictures; his young wife, Flora, one of the greatest beauties of San Francisco — and she knows it; Major Harry Larkyns, the English con artist who steals her heart and pays the ultimate price; and Governor Leland Stanford, the richest and most powerful businessman in the nation, who is both Muybridge’s greatest supporter and the engine of his most devastating downfall. Based on a true story! People remember Muybridge for his high-speed photographs of a trotting horse, which settled the long-running dispute over whether all four hooves ever leave the ground at the same time. Few remember that those photos were just a beginning for Muybridge. Through trials and tragedy he developed the technology to take an extended series of photos which became the first movies. Today he is an icon of ""steampunk,"" the burgeoning 21st century artistic and literary movement that pays homage to Victorian-era technology. Muybridge had a stormy relationship with his patron, rail tycoon Stanford. Their collaboration ended in bitter betryal and a series of disastrous lawsuits. At the peak of fame, Muybridge married Flora, a stunning beauty half his age, who betrayed him in an affair with a dashing young con artist, Major Larkyns. Muybridge murdered Larkyns in cold blood, and a spectacular “trial of the century” ended in his astonishing acquittal. Freezing Time tells this story in the form of an historical novel. While maintaining accuracy and truth about Muybridge’s life and work, Freezing Time sets him into a dramatic context that is compelling to readers who may know little about him or his photography. The exciting adventure of his life and times as depicted in Freezing Time is like Indiana Jones meets The Time Machine mixed with elements of Jack The Ripper, Sherlock Holmes, and True Grit.",, ,181,Keith  Stern, , ,4.00,4,2,Shoreham House Publishers,September 1st 2011,Kindle Edition,English,2020-15739376-freezing-time.html

1147,Bus Fare to Kentucky: The Autobiography of Skeeter Davis,"Mary Francis Penick (Skeeter Davis's Christian name) was born in a two-room shack on the banks of Eagle Creek in Glencoe, Kentucky. Energetic and imaginative, she moved so quickly that they nicknamed her Skeeter before she was in her teens. At an early age she discovered that she had an unusual singing voice. During her high school years, she teamed up with her best friend, Betty Jack Davis, and the two became recording stars under the name The Davis Sisters. Skeeter began singing her own brand of self-styled harmony to Betty Jack's lead vocals. The duo's first RCA recording in 1953, ""I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know (About Him), "" soared to the top of the charts, with the pioneering rockabilly tune ""Rock-a-Bye Boogie"" on the flip side. The singing ""sisters"" continued to earn widespread recognition until Betty Jack's tragic death in an automobile accident in 1953. In 1958, Skeeter struck out on her own under the guidance of legendary guitarist and record producer Chet Atkins. The very next year - with a top ten record, a Grammy nomination, and many record industry awards to her credit - she joined WSM's Grand Ole Opry. Her unsuccessful marriage to radio and television personality and bestselling author Ralph Emery in 1960 overshadowed the string of hits which followed. Skeeter Davis was the first female country artist to have a number-one crossover hit on the pop charts. ""The End of the World"" remains popular today and is hummed by youngsters who weren't even born when the song was introduced. Bus Fare to Kentucky tells the poignant story of a vulnerable yet tenacious woman struggling to overcome seemingly countless dramatic twists of fate. With characteristic humor, conviction, andvitality, Skeeter recalls an innocent's experience of self-discovery as well as a triumph over personal illness. A successful remission of cancer (which caused a four-year delay in completing this memoir) gave her an even stronger belief in God.

1149,"Never Before, Never Again: The Autobiography of Eddie Robinson","Franklin Roosevelt was America's President when Eddie Robinson coached his first game. Fifty-seven years later, Robison left Grambling as the winningest coach in the history of college football. Initially a coach for a segregated society, Eddie Robinson has helped football transcend race in the America he loves and treasures. Yet institutionalized racial barriers kept Robinson a secret from white America for more than 25 years until Howard Cosell did an ABC special on Grambling in the late 1960s. Outside of the world of sport, white America still barely knows him. In the African-American community, he is very likely the best-known coach in America. He is surely the most beloved. Never Before, Never Again chronicles Coach Robinson's life and his time at Grambling in vivid detail. He overcame all those things that might have predicted that it was not possible for the son of a sharecropper and a domestic worker to become a success. He got a master's degree, became the president of the American Football Coaches Association, and helping thousands of young boys become outstanding men. More than wins, they may be his greatest legacy. But as much as Coach Robinson's memoir is about sports, it's a social history history as well. The book is a lens through which readers can see the challeges and turmoil of the civil rights movements from the perspective of a sports figure who worked the playing fields of a black campus while caring deeply about the stakes and outcome of the struggle . This book places the hard-news events of the day in the time frame of the trails of Robinson's Grambling teams of that era. Also included are the thoughts of other coaches (both college and NFL) on Coach Robinson, as well as those of national leaders like Reverend Jesse Jackson, M.J. ""Mike"" Foster, the governor of Lousiana, and President Clinton. Never Before, Never Again stands as lasting testimony to the work of a true American hero.",0312242247,9780312242244,320,Eddie Robinson,Richard Lapchick, ,4.50,8,1,Thomas Dunne Books,September 24th 1999,Hardcover,English,2026-608552.Never_Before_Never_Again.html

1152,The Autobiography of Alexander Luria: A Dialogue with the Making of Mind,"Alexander Luria was one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century. His official autobiography was written as a citizen of the Soviet Union, and while it provides a compelling story of his lifelong devotion to developing a comprehensive theory of the biological and cultural foundations of human nature, it is conspicuous for the absence of information about the social context of his work and his personal struggles to be a decent person in indecent times. The current ""dialogic autobiography"" brings the vitality of Luria's ideas back to life. Michael Cole and Karl Levitin, both of whom knew Luria well and have written about his life and work, have written a carefully researched introduction and epilogue to the original autobiography. They provide readers, for the first time, with information about the social and personal contexts of Luria's remarkable achievements. Their account is supplemented by a DVD with reminiscences of leading psychologists from around the world who knew and worked with Luria. At last, Luria's life and science are brought together in a single volume. The book will appeal to psychologists, neuropsychologists, and other scientists interested in Luria's life achievements.",0805854991,9780805854992,276,Michael Cole,Karl Levitin,Alexander R.

He talks candidly of the bizarre rumor mill that followed the Irish team through the World Cup tournament and takes us behind the scenes of a story that tossed an entire nation into mourning. O'Sullivan writes with surprising candor about his relationships with his successor as Irish coach, Declan Kidney, and his predecessor, Warren Gatland.

1159,Greg Sorbara: The Battlefield of Ontario Politics: An Autobiography,"Greg Sorbara has enjoyed one of the most successful careers of any Ontario politician, and in two different Liberal administrations. He was appointed minister of finance by Premier Dalton McGuinty in 2003, and served as campaign chair for the Liberals' three consecutive election victories — the first time that had happened in more than a century. First elected in 1985, Sorbara was also in the cabinet of Premier David Peterson — the first Liberal leader elected in Ontario in forty-two years. Through his quarter-century of public life in the province, Sorbara had an enviable record of introducing new policies to help Ontarians, while having the guts to raise taxes to pay for those programs. A reinvigorated health-care system, the Ontario Child Benefit, and a subway to York University all have Sorbara's fingerprints on them. In Greg Sorbara: The Battlefield of Ontario Politics , the author brings you into the back rooms of the Ontario Liberal Party as some of the most significant changes in Ontario's political history are made.

Grace Lee Boggs, Chinese American, middle class, highly educated, discovers through her encounters with remarkable rebels, blue collars as well as philosophers, where the body is buried: who is doing what to whom in our society. It is an adventure that is truly liberating"". Studs Terkel""Grace Lee Boggs has made a fundamental difference in keeping alive the traditions of the struggles for freedom and democracy"". Cornel West Living for Change is a sweeping account of the life of an untraditional radical from the end of the thirties, through the cold war, the civil rights era, and the rise of Black Power, the Nation of Islam, and the Black Panthers to the present efforts to rebuild our crumbling urban communities. This fascinating autobiography traces the story of a woman who transcended class and racial boundaries to pursue her passionate belief in a better society. Grace Lee Boggs was raised in New York City during a time when her father was not allowed to buy land for their home because he was Chinese. Educated at Barnard and Bryn Mawr, Boggs was in her twenties when radical politics beckoned, and she was inspired to become a revolutionary focusing on the black community. During her early years as an activist in New York, Boggs began a twenty-year friendship and collaboration with C. L. R. James, the brilliant and influential West Indian Marxist to whom she devotes a revelatory chapter of this book. In 1953, she moved to Detroit where, she writes, ""radical history had been made and could be made again"". It was also the home of James Boggs, an African American auto worker (and later author and revolutionarytheoretician) who would become one of the movement's freshest and most persuasive voices, as well as Grace's husband. Beginning with their work together on the newsletter Correspondence, Grace and James formed the core of a network that over the years would include Malcolm X, Lyman Paine, Ping Ferry, Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, Kwame Nkrumah, Stokely Carmichael, and inner-city youth. Rich in the personalities and anecdotes of twentieth-century progressive activism, Living for Change is an involving and inspiring look at a remarkable woman who continues to dedicate her life to social justice.",0816629552,9780816629558,328,Grace Lee Boggs,Ossie Davis, ,4.06,124,20,Univ Of Minnesota Press,March 1st 1998,Paperback,English,204-348709.Living_For_Change.html

In a volume that continues to resonate more than seventy years after its initial publication, Frank Lloyd Wright: An Autobiography contains the master architect's own account of his work, his philosophy, and his personal life, written with his signature wit and charm. Wright (1867-1959) went into seclusion in a Minnesota cabin to reflect and to record his life experiences. In 1932, the first edition of the Autobiography was published. It became a form of advertising, leading many readers to seek out the master architect--thirty apprentices came to live and learn at Taliesin, Wright's Wisconsin home/school/studio, under the master's tutelage. (By 1938, Taliesin West, in Arizona, was the winter location for Wright's school.) The volume is divided into five sections devoted to family, fellowship, work, freedom, and form.

1177,The Value of Solitude: The Ethics and Spirituality of Aloneness in Autobiography,"Most people feel ambivalent about solitude, both loving and fearing it depending on how they experience being alone at certain points in their lives. In ""The Value of Solitude, "" John Barbour explores some of the ways in which experiences of solitude, both positive and negative, have been interpreted as religiously significant. He also shows how solitude can raise ethical questions as writers evaluate the virtues and dangers of aloneness and consider how social interaction and withdrawal can most meaningfully be combined in a life. Barbour's work differs from previous books about solitude in two ways: it links solitude with ethics and spirituality, and it approaches solitude by way of autobiography. Barbour ranges from the early Christian and medieval periods to the twentieth century in examining the varieties of solitary experience of writers such as Augustine, Petrarch, Montaigne, Gibbon, Rousseau, Thoreau, Thomas Merton, and Paul Auster. For many authors, the process of writing an autobiography is itself conceived of as a form of solitude, a detachment from others in order to discover or create a new sense of personal identity. Solitude helps these authors to reorient their lives according to their moral ideals and spiritual aspirations. ""The Value of Solitude"" both traces the persistence and vitality of the theme of solitude in autobiography and shows how the literary form and structure of autobiography are shaped by ethical and religious reflection on aloneness. This work should appeal to scholars in the fields of religious studies and theology, to literary critics and specialists in autobiography, and to readers interested in the experience of solitude and its moral and spiritual significance.",0813922895,9780813922898,240,John D.

1179,Shameful Autobiographies: Shame in Contemporary Australian Autobiographies and Culture,"Perhaps it is this element of risk, together with the magnetism of another person's confession of shameful experience, that make us such avid readers of autobiography. Rosamund Dalziell proposes that shame is the driving force in many Australian autobiographies. Indeed, she suggests that the representation of shame is fundamental to the autobiographical process. Shame seeks concealment-and this, she argues, explains both why this fascinating link has not before been explored and why, when it is pointed out, we immediately know it to be authentic. The calm clarity of Rosamund Dalziell's writing strengthens her powerful insights and arguments, the most potent of which is that autobiographical confrontion with shame can heal deep wounds, both for writers and for readers.

1187,The Mourning Tree: An Autobiography and a Prison Memoir,"This prison memoir will not only give first-hand information of the experience of the brutalities of Siyad Barre’s Somalia but also of the life of a nomad child who is brought to the city to live with his aunt because there was no work for him due to the fact that his father did not own any camels to be looked after. In the city while growing up, hunger was never far away. That motivated Mohamed to perform well at school which gave him the opportunity to go to the United Kingdom. After he earned his university degree, he went back to his home town Hargeysa where he met young professionals’ like him. They decided to volunteer for their community, what became to be known by the international community as Hargeysa Self-help group and locally as UFFO. For their noble acts, Mohamed and his colleagues were imprisoned and what followed were eight long lonely years, where the studying of insects was the main entertainment of the day. The reasons why they were freed, while at the same time the rest of their community had been destroyed, were as strange and surprising as the reasons why they were jailed in the first place were bizarre. There was no time in Mohamed’s life to get depressed or discouraged when he and his group were freed as the reconstruction of the country had to start immediately.",888893412X,9788888934129,214,Mohamed Barud Ali, , ,5.00,4,1,Ponte Invisible,February 20th 2010,Paperback,English,2060-20912097-the-mourning-tree.html

1190,Guided By The Light: The Autobiography Of A Born Medium,"Described by Professor Hans Holzer, a leading authority in America on the paranormal, as the greatest medium of our time, Philip Solomon shares his amazing story, from his childhood psychic experiences of been born into a gifted family with show business connections, through his many strands of spiritual and psychical development, to the finely honed, highly attuned state of awareness he has achieved. For those of you who think that mediumship is merely passing on messages from beyond the grave to members of a spiritualist church or theatre audience, then your eyes are about to be opened, as this book covers predictions, meditation, hypnotism, sports psychology, guides and angels, ghosts and the paranormal, healing, astrology, leylines and UFOs, with an emphasis on the innate ability in each and every one of us to develop psychic awareness. With a fitting foreword by respected fellow-medium, Derek Acorah, this book will definitely challenge your perceptions and broaden your outlook on life, both on the earth plane and in the spirit world beyond. In this and his many previous books, Philip Solomon’s intentions and convictions are clear. He has been chosen by Spirit to walk a sometimes difficult pathway on a mission to prove beyond doubt the existence of life after death and other-worldliness and to assure those that have lost loved ones that death is not the end.",1906358036,9781906358037,170,Philip Solomon,Derek Acorah, ,3.75,4,0,Apex Publishing Ltd,December 31st 1969,Paperback,English,2063-2383550.Guided_By_The_Light.html

1193,Life and Shape: The Autobiography of Richard Neutra,"Since he followed it all of his life, Richard Neutra (1892-1970) must have relished the maxim of the Greek philosopher Socrates: ""The unexamined life is not worth living."" In his books, articles, lectures, correspondence, and even casual conversations, Neutra constantly examined, not only his own life, but the lives of others - present and past - and the human and natural world they inhabited. Nowhere was this truer than in his autobiography ""Life and Shape,"" first published in 1962, which now, after years of being out of print, has again happily come back to life. As opposed to ""Survival Through Design"" (1954), his superb collection of densely philosophical essays, Neutra took a different tack in ""Life and Shape,"" following a lighter and more deliberately relaxed approach. It was as if the usually serious and intense Neutra was giving himself permission to reveal his richly ironic sense of humor and to probe areas in his personal experience which he had not examined as closely before. These included hitherto unrecorded memories of his parents, siblings, and his childhood and education in imperial Vienna, his numbing experiences as an Austrian artillery officer in World War I, and the beginnings of his architectural consciousness in his response to the work of Otto Wagner, Adolf Loos, Erich Mendelsohn, Louis Sullivan, and Frank Lloyd Wright. As in the autobiographies of Sullivan and Wright, ""Life and Shape"" concentrates on Neutra's earlier years, both in Europe and America. While he naturally recounts his memories of such well-known commissions as the Lovell Health House (1929), his own Van der Leeuv Research House (1933) and the von Sternberg House (1935), he also muses on such less famous buildings as the small, and now virtually forgotten, Mosk House (1933). ""Life and Shape"" also confirms Neutra's obsession with the passage of time and his firm resolution never to waste it. Like Sullivan and Wright, Neutra eschewed writing a factual chronicle, and - at the age of 70 - composed instead a meditation on the aspects of his life and work that seemed, in retrospect, to be the most interesting and significant. He felt no need to try to ""include everything"" but rather to present an honest recounting of his memory of his life. In writing my own ""Richard Neutra and the Search for Modern Architecture"" [Oxford University Press, 1982; Rizzoli Press, 2006], I relied on ""Life and Shape"" when I wanted an account of Neutra's experiences told in his own authentic voice. For future generations of architects, historian, and readers, it is good to have it back. - Thomas S. Hines, UCLA Professor Emeritus of History and Architecture",098222513X,9780982225134,379,Richard Neutra,Dion Neutra, ,4.00,4,0,Atara Press,September 15th 2009,Paperback,English,2066-8942141-life-and-shape.html

1212,On Reflection: An Autobiography,"In addressing her grandchildren in the foreword to this autobiography, Helen Hayes writes: 'It is no longer fashionable to have faith; but your grandmother has never been famous for her chic.' It is, in fact, because of her tenacious faith in the world that Helen Hayes decided to write this book as a legacy for her grandchildren; to be read one day when they are grown. In setting down all the family stories, the backstage anecdotes and her recollections of spiritual struggle, she has produced a legacy for all of us. After years of unwillingness to discuss her private world which even her bestselling book A Gift of Joy did not do she has looked beyond her legend and directly at life s lessons as she was forced to learn them. Deeply moving and affectionately witty, her autobiography is an affirmation of the faith that first gave it impetus. All the Helens are here: the unrehearsed child and her shy but ambitious mother; the young actress who so appealed to such luminaries as John Drew and William Gillette; the young woman who forged a marriage with a brilliant renegade named Charles MacArthur; the mother of Mary and Jim; the keeper of an endless procession of hilariously tyrannical poodles; the friend of Fitzgerald, Harpo Marx and Dietrich; the lady who became out First Lady of the Theater; the mature woman, looking forward; and still, and always, the actress. On Reflection is in every sense, an unforgettable book.""",159077289X,9781590772898,253,Helen Hayes,Sandford Dody, ,0.00,0,0,M.

In this context, Smith thinks through Derrida's texts in a new way, and finds new perspectives to analyze classical writers including Hegel, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Freud and de Man.",0521460050,9780521460057,208,Robert Smith, , ,0.00,0,0,Cambridge University Press,June 30th 1995,Hardcover,English,2093-3565406-derrida-and-autobiography.html

1225,Come Up and Get Me: An Autobiography of Colonel Joe Kittinger,"A few years after his release from a North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp in 1973, Colonel Joseph Kittinger retired from the Air Force. Restless and unchallenged, he turned to ballooning, a lifelong passion as well as a constant diversion for his imagination during his imprisonment. His primary goal was a solitary circumnavigation of the globe, and in its pursuit he set several ballooning distance records, including the first solo crossing of the Atlantic in 1984. But the aeronautical feats that first made him an American hero had occurred a quarter of a century earlier. By the time Kittinger was shot down in Vietnam in 1972, his Air Force career was already legendary. He had made a name for himself at Holloman Air Force Base near Alamogordo, New Mexico, as a test pilot who helped demonstrate that egress survival for pilots at high altitudes was possible in emergency situations. Ironically, Kittinger and his pre-astronaut colleagues would help propel Americans into space using the world's oldest flying machine--the balloon. Kittinger's work on Project Excelsior--which involved daring high-altitude bailout tests--earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross long before he earned a collection of medals in Vietnam. Despite the many accolades, Kittinger's proudest moment remains his free fall from 102,800 feet during which he achieved a speed of 614 miles per hour.",0826348041,9780826348043,272,Joe Kittinger,Craig Ryan, ,4.06,16,2,University of New Mexico Press,April 16th 2011,Paperback,English,2095-11709169-come-up-and-get-me.html
1226,"The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin Including Poor Richard's Almanac, and Familiar Letters","Printer, author, philanthropist, abolitionist, scientist, librarian, diplomat, inventor, philosopher, self-aggrandizer, and social wag, Benjamin Franklin is one of the most fascinating characters in all of American history-a quality that was not lost on the man himself, as his autobiography makes plain. Avoiding the strife of the American Revolution entirely, Franklin focuses his incisive wit on the culture and society of colonial Philadelphia, weaving a mostly true mythology of humble origins and hard work that created the concepts of ""The American Dream"" and ""the self-made man."" This edition includes letters written by Franklin as well as ""Poor Richard's Almanac,"" a popular pamphlet that was continuously reprinted from 1732-1758. Franklin's Autobiography, originally published in French in 1791, and translated into English and published in London in 1793, is considered the great autobiography of life in colonial America. American icon BENJAMIN FRANKLIN (1706-1790), born in Massachusetts to a British immigrant father and colonial mother, published the famous ""Poor Richard's Almanac,"" helped found the University of Pennsylvania, and was the first Postmaster General of the United States.

1230,Writings: Autobiography/Notes on the State of Virginia/Public & Private Papers/Addresses/Letters,"Now fully represented in this Library of America volume is the most comprehensive testimony of the writings of our third president and foremost spokesperson for democracy. Thomas Jefferson, a brilliant political thinker, is perhaps best known for the Declaration of Independence, but he was a man of extraordinarily wide interests. He was exceptionally controversial in his own time, and many of his ideas remain the subject of national debate. In his arguments for a system of general education, for local rather than central authority, for caution in international affairs, for religious and intellectual freedom, and for economic and social justice, Jefferson defined the issues that still direct our national political life centuries after the nation's formation. This volume will give readers the opportunity to reassess one of our most influential presidents. Jefferson's First Inaugural Address is a resounding statement of faith in a democracy of enlightened people. His Notes on the State of Virginia (1785) is an invaluable record of the landscape, inhabitants, life, and daily customs of America in the Revolutionary and early national eras. His letters, more than two hundred and fifty of which are gathered here, are brilliant urbane missives to such men as Patrick Henry, Thomas Paine, Lafayette, John Adams and James Madison. His slim Autobiography (1821), written ""for my own more ready reference, and for the information of my family,"" hardly hints at the influence and impact he had as Secretary of State under George Washington, Minister to France, opposition-party Vice President to John Adams, and, after leaving the presidency, founder of the University of Virginia. His public papers and addresses fully demonstrate both the breadth of his interests and the power of his expressive mind. Extensively read (his personal library of ten thousand volumes became the foundation of the Library of Congress) and widely traveled, Jefferson wrote with ease and spontaneity about science, archaeology, botany and gardening, religion, literature, architecture, education, the habits of his fellow citizens, and, of course, his beloved home, Monticello. Jefferson's prose has an energy, clarity, and charming off-handedness, consistent with his conviction that style in writing should impose no barrier between the most educated and the most common reader. For those who want a renewed sense of the opportunity for human freedom that the United States represented to its founders, this is an indispensable book. Merrill D. Peterson, volume editor, is professor emeritus of history at the University of Virginia, and is author of Thomas Jefferson and the New Nation: A Biography, Lincoln in American Memory, and Starving Armenians: America and the Armenian Genocide, 1915–1930 and After. The library of America is dedicated to publishing America's best and most significant writing in handsome, enduring volumes, featuring authoritative texts. Hailed as the ""finest-looking, longest-lasting editions ever made"" (The New Republic), Library of America volumes make a fine gift for any occasion.

1235,Porn King: The Autobiography of John C. Holmes,"Autobiography of the KING of PORN In the world of adult cinema, one name stands out above all others: John Holmes. For nearly 20 years, from 1967 to 1987, Holmes reigned as the undisputed King of X-rated films, having appeared in a record 2,200 plus productions, from the landmark Johnny Wadd movies (one of which became the first adult motion picture to gross over $1 million) to the legendary Insatiable with Marilyn Chambers. To a legion of fans World-wide, he was known as “Mr. Big.” To industry insiders, he was “Mr. Nice Guy.” Yet for all of his fame and notoriety, Holmes remained an intensely private person and a mystery man. That is, until now. In a startlingly frank autobiography, PORN KING was written in large part prior to his death (with new material added by his widow, Laurie,) Holmes tells the story of his incredible life. This is not a typical celebrity story, filled with bright lights and glamour, giant sound stages and movie moguls. It is, instead, a rare portrait of a young man drawn into an unknown Hollywood, a secret, forbidden Hollywood, and the parallels between his astounding career and the sexual revolution in American films. Holmes knew his subject better than anyone. Holmes candidly tells of a lucrative but often harrowing “other” life as a male prostitute to the rich and famous, a shattering fall into drugs and his side of the grisly Wonderland Murders and his desperate cross-country flight afterwards. From start to finish, in this newly revised edition, complete with never-before-seen candid photos of Holmes in his private life, PORN KING is a sizzling, sensuous, fast-paced story laced with controversy.",, ,192,John C.

He studied at the University of Pennsylvania, and received the degree of M. D. at Jefferson Medical College in 1850. His medical texts include Injuries of Nerves and Their Consequences (1872) and Fat and Blood (1877). In 1863 he wrote a clever short story, combining physiological and psychological problems, entitled The Case of George Dedlow, in the Atlantic Monthly Magazine. Thenceforward Dr Weir Mitchell, as a writer, divided his attention between professional and literary pursuits. His historical novels, Hugh Wynne, Free Quaker (1897), The Adventures of François (1898) and The Red City (1909), take high rank in this branch of fiction. He was also Charlotte Perkins Gilman's doctor and his use of a rest cure on her provided the idea for The Yellow Wallpaper, a short story in which the narrator is driven insane by her rest cure.",0548563454,9780548563458,164,S.

1239,Writing the South through the Self: Explorations in Southern Autobiography,"Drawing on two decades of teaching a college-level course on southern history as viewed through autobiography and memoir, John C. Inscoe has crafted a series of essays exploring the southern experience as reflected in the life stories of those who lived it. Constantly attuned to the pedagogical value of these narratives, Inscoe argues that they offer exceptional means of teaching young people because the authors focus so fully on their confrontations—as children, adolescents, and young adults—with aspects of southern life that they found to be troublesome, perplexing, or challenging. Maya Angelou, Rick Bragg, Jimmy Carter, Bessie and Sadie Delany, Willie Morris, Pauli Murray, Lillian Smith, and Thomas Wolfe are among the more prominent of the many writers, both famous and obscure, that Inscoe draws on to construct a composite portrait of the South at its most complex and diverse. The power of place; struggles with racial, ethnic, and class identities; the strength and strains of family; educational opportunities both embraced and thwarted—all of these are themes that infuse the works in this most intimate and humanistic of historical genres. Full of powerful and poignant stories, anecdotes, and testimonials, Writing the South through the Self explores the emotional and psychological dimensions of what it has meant to be southern and offers us new ways of understanding the forces that have shaped southern identity in such multifaceted ways.",0820337676,9780820337678,268,John C.

1240,The Only One Living to Tell: The Autobiography of a Yavapai Indian,"Mike Burns--born Hoomothya--was around eight years old in 1872 when the US military murdered his family and as many as seventy-six other Yavapai men, women, and children in the Skeleton Cave Massacre in Arizona. One of only a few young survivors, he was adopted by an army captain and ended up serving as a scout in the US army and adventuring in the West. Before his death in 1934, Burns wrote about the massacre, his time fighting in the Indian Wars during the 1880s, and life among the Kwevkepaya and Tolkepaya Yavapai. His precarious position between the white and Native worlds gives his account a distinctive narrative voice. Because Burns was unable to find a publisher during his lifetime, these firsthand accounts of history from a Native perspective remained unseen through much of the twentieth century, archived at the Sharlot Hall Museum in Prescott. Now Gregory McNamee has brought Burns's text to life, making this extraordinary tale an accessible and compelling read. Generations after his death, Mike Burns finally gets a chance to tell his story. This autobiography offers a missing piece of Arizona history--as one of the only Native American accounts of the Skeleton Cave Massacre--and contributes to a growing body of history from a Native perspective. It will be an indispensable tool for scholars and general readers interested in the West--specifically Arizona history, the Apache wars, and Yavapai and Apache history and lifeways.",0816501203,9780816501205,176,Mike Burns,Gregory McNamee, ,4.00,3,0,University of Arizona Press,April 1st 2012,Paperback,English,2109-13226624-the-only-one-living-to-tell.html

1242,Like a Waking Dream: The Autobiography of Geshe Lhundub Sopa,"Among the generation of elder Tibetan lamas who brought Tibetan Buddhism west in the latter half of the twentieth century, perhaps none has had a greater impact on the academic study of Buddhism than Geshe Lhundub Sopa. He has striven to preserve Tibetan religious culture through tireless work as a professor and religious figure, establishing a functioning Buddhist monastery in the West, organizing the Dalai Lama's visits to the U.S., and offering countless teachings across the country. But prior to his thirty-year career in the first ever academic Buddhist studies program in the United States - a position in which he oversaw the training of many among the seminal generation of American Buddhist studies scholars - Geshe Sopa was the son of peasant farmers, a novice monk in a rural monastery, a virtuoso scholar-monk at one of the prestigious central monasteries in Lhasa, and a survivor of the Tibetan uprising and perilous flight into exile in 1959. In Like a Waking Dream , Geshe Sopa frankly and observantly reflects on how his life in Tibet - a monastic life of yogic simplicity - shaped and prepared him for the unexpected. His is a tale of an exemplary life dedicated to learning, spiritual cultivation, and the service of others from one of the greatest living masters of Tibetan Buddhism.",0861713133,9780861713134,368,Lhundub Sopa,Paul Donnelly, ,4.67,6,2,Wisdom Publications,November 20th 2012,Hardcover,English,2110-13590661-like-a-waking-dream.html

1252,Autobiography of Yukichi Fukuzawa,"Here is the autobiography of a remarkable man. Yukichi Fukuzawa's life covered the 66 years between 1835 and 1901, a period which comprised greater and more extraordinary changes than any other in the history of Japan. In his country's swift transformation from an isolated feudal state to a full-fledged member of the modern world, Fukuzawa played a leading role: he was the educator of the new Japan, the man who above all others explained to his countrymen the ideas behind the dazzling material evidence of Western civilization. Dictated by Fukuzawa in 1897, this book vividly relates his story, from his childhood as a member of the lower samurai class in a small, caste-bound village. His escape from the hopeless destiny decreed by his social position, his adventures as a student of Dutch (the language of the only Westerners allowed in Japan), his travels aboard the first Japanese ship to sail to America -- all prepared Fukuzawa to write Seiyo Jijo (Things Western), the book which made him famous. His special perspective on Japan's tempestuous 19th century gives Fukuzawa's life story added fascination.",0231083734,9780231083737,407,Yukichi Fukuzawa,Eiichi Kiyooka, ,3.92,252,18,Columbia University Press,March 1st 1980,Paperback,English,212-1596229.Autobiography_of_Yukichi_Fukuzawa.html

Three Villages is more than a memoir, it is a living history of Ireland by a man who has written about it for three decades. This book will teach you as much about Ireland as any history book. Here, through the inimitable pen of Foley, Ireland comes alive. Includes introductions by Maeve Binchy and Mary Maher.

It saved me, and 50 years on that hasn't changed one bit—I’d be lost without it… Harry Redknapp is the manager who has seen it all—from training pitches with trees in the middle to the unbeatable highs of the Premiership, lifting the FA Cup and taking on Real Madrid in the Champions League. With his much loved, no-nonsense delivery, Harry brings us a story filled with passion and humor that takes you right inside every drama of his career. Harry finally tells the full story of all the controversial ups and downs—the pain and heartache of his court case, the England job, his love for Bobby Moore, his adventures at Portsmouth with Milan Mandaric, Tottenham and Daniel Levy, and not forgetting his years at West Ham or the challenges at his current club QPR. It's the epic journey of one of the great managers and, along the way, the story of the British game itself over the last five decades.

Born into a middle-class Jewish family in mid-1920s Vienna, Kaufman escaped to England on the eve of the Second World War. In 1940, he was interned as an 'enemy alien' and sent to Canada.

Since his retirement in 1991, Kaufman has led numerous commissions and inquiries, most notably the investigation into the wrongful conviction of Guy Paul Morin and the two-year reassessment of the Steven Truscott case.

1285,Musui's Story: The Autobiography of a Tokugawa Samurai,"A series of picaresque adventures set against the backdrop of a Japan still closed off from the rest of the world, Musui's Story recounts the escapades of samurai Katsu Kokichi. As it depicts Katsu stealing, brawling, indulging in the pleasure quarters, and getting the better of authorities, it also provides a refreshing perspective on Japanese society, customs, economy, and human relationships. From childhood Katsu was given to mischief. He ran away from home, once at thirteen, making his way as a beggar on the great trunk road between Edo and Kyoto, and again at twenty, posing as the emissary of a feudal lord. He eventually married and had children but never obtained official preferment and was forced to supplement a meager stipend by dealing in swords, selling protection to shopkeepers, and generally using his muscle and wits. Katsu's descriptions of loyalty and kindness, greed and deception, vanity and superstition offer an intimate view of daily life in nineteenth-century Japan unavailable in standard history books. Musui's Story will delight not only students of Japan's past but also general readers who will be entranced by Katsu's candor and boundless zest for life.",0816512566,9780816512560,174,Kokichi Katsu,Ando Hiroshige,Teruko Craig,3.48,407,22,University of Arizona Press,July 1st 1988,Paperback,English,215-231561.Musui_s_Story.html

Whenever somebody wants to get something off their chest, the advice is often: ""Talk to Joe."" Writing with raw honesty, Joe here recounts his difficult upbringing in working-class Ballyfermot.

Joe writes with candor about his own brother Brendan, who has spent time in prison for drug-related offenses. Aspirations for a better life were rarely encouraged in Ballyfermot.

He became one of the first from his area to enter the hallowed halls of Trinity College Dublin, where he developed a strong sense of social justice, eventually becoming President of the Union of Students in Ireland, and leading protests on campus highlighting access to education. After a stint working in the probation service, Joe eventually moved into a career in broadcasting, working first as producer and then roving reporter on The Gay Byrne Show , before finally finding his niche on LiveLine .

1295,"History, Historians, and Autobiography","Though history and autobiography both claim to tell true stories about the past, historians have traditionally rejected first-person accounts as subjective and therefore unreliable. What then, asks Jeremy D. Popkin in History, Historians, and Autobiography , are we to make of the ever-increasing number of professional historians who are publishing stories of their own lives? And how is this recent development changing the nature of history-writing, the historical profession, and the genre of autobiography? Drawing on the theoretical work of contemporary critics of autobiography and the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur, Popkin reads the autobiographical classics of Edward Gibbon and Henry Adams and the memoirs of contemporary historians such as Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Peter Gay, Jill Ker Conway, and many others, he reveals the contributions historians' life stories make to our understanding of the human experience. Historians' autobiographies, he shows, reveal how scholars arrive at their vocations, the difficulties of writing about modern professional life, and the ways in which personal stories can add to our understanding of historical events such as war, political movements, and the traumas of the Holocaust. An engrossing overview of the way historians view themselves and their profession, this work will be of interest to readers concerned with the ways in which we understand the past, as well as anyone interested in the art of life-writing.",0226675432,9780226675435,328,Jeremy D.

1308,The Time of My Life: An Autobiography,"For more than 30 years, Gay Byrne has broadcast on Irish radio and television. He tells his life story of growing up in Dublin and how he became a household name by the time he was 30. He tells how he copes with the stress of stardom on his private family life. The youngest of six children growing up on Dublin's South Circular Road in the 1940s and '50s he could never have foreseen that he would become the celebrity of later years. But this son of the captain of a Guinness barge was to become a household name by the time he was 30 and establish himself as the outstanding figure in Irish life, outshining every other prominent individual by the flair and consistency of his performance and by an extraordinary capacity for hard work. Early days in radio (while working as an insurance clerk) led inevitably to television, first at Granada and then the BBC. The beginning of Telefis Eireann in 1961 opened a unique opportunity which was grasped eagerly and the Late Late Show was first broadcast - as a filler in the summer schedule - during 1962.",0717116158,9780717116157,255,Gay Byrne, , ,3.80,5,0,Gill & MacMillan,January 1st 1989,Unknown Binding,English,2170-4809200-the-time-of-my-life.html

1315,The Autobiography of W. Harry Davis,"W. Harry Davis has been a leading voice for civil rights in his native Minneapolis for more than four decades. Rising from the impoverished North Side ghetto of his childhood, he became the founding chief executive of the Minneapolis Urban Coalition, a twenty-year member of the city's school board, and one of the first black executives at a major Twin Cities corporation. Along the way he overcame polio, became the region's most successful amateur boxing coach, led a historic church merger, founded a bank, served on the U.S. Olympic boxing committee, and campaigned as the city's first black mayoral candidate. Davis's story serves as a reminder that the civil-rights movement was not confined to places like Selma and Birmingham, but also transformed lives for the better in Minneapolis and around the county. Told with Davis's characteristic generosity of spirit, it will also inspire hope in anyone who has ever wondered whether life's obstacles can be overcome.",1890434523,9781890434526,312,W.

1317,Jesus: My Autobiography,"“I have come at this time, in this place, and through this being to speak my truth, to speak the story of my life — the true story of my life.” The purpose of this book is to clarify, to tell the truth, and to share my energies with you so that you can begin the transformation of your mind and, therefore, the transformation of your heart and your world. It is in the misteachings that have been associated with my name that much death and pain has been caused and that much guilt and self-recrimination has been expressed. That was not my purpose; that was not my lesson. This story will begin the change. It will not make the change. It will facilitate turning the key in the lock, but you must open the door and walk through it into a new realm that is opened by this information. That is your responsibility. We can only bring you the message, this channel and I. We can only work together to transmit the information, but it is through your actions and your transformation that you will see a change in your world, a change in the subjective world that is manufactured from your beliefs, your thoughts, and your feelings. I talk about the truth of my birth and the truth of my life. I cover some stories that are recounted in the Bible and tell you the true story of those events. I describe some of my personal traits, my human traits, and I define what I am, who I am, and why these things happened. You will be able to understand the truth, and you will begin this reconditioning, this retooling of your mind — of your thoughts and beliefs — on this subject of my life, my meaning, and my purpose, for it is a long process. The time is ripe. The need for a spiritual revolution is here. — Jesus",, ,0,Tina Louise Spalding, , ,5.00,4,2,Light Technology Publishing,June 17th 2015,Kindle Edition,English,2179-25752462-jesus.html

1319,Twenty Thousand Mornings: An Autobiography,"When John Joseph Mathews (1894–1979) began his career as a writer in the 1930s, he was one of only a small number of Native American authors writing for a national audience. Today he is widely recognized as a founder and shaper of twentieth-century Native American literature. Twenty Thousand Mornings is Mathews’s intimate chronicle of his formative years. Written in 1965-67 but only recently discovered, this work captures Osage life in pre-statehood Oklahoma and recounts many remarkable events in early-twentieth-century history. Born in Pawhuska, Osage Nation, Mathews was the only surviving son of a mixed-blood Osage father and a French-American mother. Within these pages he lovingly depicts his close relationships with family members and friends. Yet always drawn to solitude and the natural world, he wanders the Osage Hills in search of tranquil swimming holes—and new adventures. Overturning misguided critical attempts to confine Mathews to either Indian or white identity, Twenty Thousand Mornings shows him as a young man of his time. He goes to dances and movies, attends the brand-new University of Oklahoma, and joins the Air Service as a flight instructor during World War I—spawning a lifelong fascination with aviation. His accounts of wartime experiences include unforgettable descriptions of his first solo flight and growing skill in night-flying. Eventually Mathews gives up piloting to become a student again, this time at Oxford University, where he begins to mature as an intellectual. In her insightful introduction and explanatory notes , Susan Kalter places Mathews’s work in the context of his life and career as a novelist, historian, naturalist, and scholar. Kalter draws on his unpublished diaries, revealing aspects of his personal life that have previously been misunderstood. In addressing the significance of this posthumous work, she posits that Twenty Thousand Mornings will challenge, defy, and perhaps redefine studies of American Indian autobiography.”",0806142537,9780806142531,360,John Joseph Mathews,Susan Kalter,Charles H.

1321,Postcolonial Theory and Autobiography,"Cultural theory has often been criticized for covert Eurocentric and universalist tendencies. Its concepts and ideas are implicitly applicable to everyone, ironing over any individuality or cultural difference. Postcolonial theory has challenged these limitations of cultural theory, and Postcolonial Theory and Autobiography addresses the central challenge posed by its autobiographical turn. Despite the fact that autobiography is frequently dismissed for its Western, masculine bias, David Huddart argues for its continued relevance as a central explanatory category in understanding postcolonial theory and its relation to subjectivity. Focusing on the influence of post-structuralist theory on postcolonial theory and vice versa, this study suggests that autobiography constitutes a general philosophical resistance to universal concepts and theories. Offering a fresh perspective on familiar critical figures like Edward W. Said and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, by putting them in the context of readings of the work of Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, and Alain Badiou, this book relates the theory of autobiography to expressions of new universalisms that, together with postcolonial theory, rethink and extend norms of experience, investigation, and knowledge.",0203306570,9780203306574,200,David Huddart, , ,0.00,0,0,Routledge,October 26th 2007,ebook,English,2182-10366574-postcolonial-theory-and-autobiography.html

1324,"Autobiography of Mark Twain: Ruminations on His Life and Times, in His Own Words, Volume 1","John Hay once told Mark Twain that when a man has reached forty years old, he has already done whatever was worth doing in his life and should start writing his autobiography; invariably, whether trying to be truthful or intentionally inventing fictions, the real truth of the man's life will be apparent to the reader. He went on to say that ""there is a subtle devilish something or other about autobiographical composition that defeats all the writer's attempts to paint his portrait his way."" With this in mind, Mark Twain began writing his autobiography, at the age of forty-two. He struggled with what to write about and in what order, frequently abandoning the project and returning to it every few years before finally hitting upon on the best way to write an autobiography: ""Start it at no particular time of your life; wander at your free will all over your life; talk only about the thing which interests you for the moment; drop it the moment its interest threatens to pale, and turn your talk upon the new and more interesting thing that has intruded itself into your mind meantime."" This volume collects a number of Twain's autobiographical writings, collected from a variety of manuscripts, articles and dictations dated between 1870 and 1906. A true treasure for the fan of Mark Twain and American history and literature, the events described and the ruminations of America's greatest wit give a rare glimpse into another time and a gifted mind. Even though more than one hundred years have passed since Twain's thoughts and observations have been put to paper, they remain just as clever, humorous and insightful in modern times. This edition has been carefully produced with the reader in mind. The texts have been meticulously proofread and formatted with the Kindle screen in mind to create an optimum reading experience. As a bonus, photos of Mark Twain and his family have been included as well as a brief overview of Twain's life and legacy. There is no doubt that this edition will be an absolute pleasure to read for the Twain fan and casual reader alike.",, ,760,Mark Twain, , ,4.00,22,2, , ,Kindle Edition,English,2185-10764131-autobiography-of-mark-twain.html

Although his face became familiar to the world at that time, his ideas and his program were mainly a subject of speculation.

1326,Mirror to America: The Autobiography of John Hope Franklin,"John Hope Franklin lived through America’s most defining twentieth-century transformation, the dismantling of legally protected racial segregation. A renowned scholar, he has explored that transformation in its myriad aspects, notably in his 3.5-million-copy bestseller, From Slavery to Freedom . Born in 1915, he, like every other African American, could not help but participate: he was evicted from whites-only train cars, confined to segregated schools, threatened—once with lynching—and consistently subjected to racism’s denigration of his humanity. Yet he managed to receive a Ph.D. from Harvard; become the first black historian to assume a full professorship at a white institution, Brooklyn College; and be appointed chair of the University of Chicago’s history department and, later, John B. Duke Professor at Duke University. He has reshaped the way African American history is understood and taught and become one of the world’s most celebrated historians, garnering over 130 honorary degrees. But Franklin’s participation was much more fundamental than that. From his effort in 1934 to hand President Franklin Roosevelt a petition calling for action in response to the Cordie Cheek lynching, to his 1997 appointment by President Clinton to head the President’s Initiative on Race, and continuing to the present, Franklin has influenced with determination and dignity the nation’s racial conscience. Whether aiding Thurgood Marshall’s preparation for arguing Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, marching to Montgomery, Alabama, in 1965, or testifying against Robert Bork’s nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987, Franklin has pushed the national conversation on race toward humanity and equality, a life long effort that earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, in 1995. Intimate, at times revelatory, Mirror to America chronicles Franklin’s life and this nation’s racial transformation in the twentieth century, and is a powerful reminder of the extent to which the problem of America remains the problem of color.",0374299447,9780374299446,416,John Hope Franklin, , ,4.19,164,30,Farra,November 2nd 2005,Hardcover,English,2187-637865.Mirror_to_America.html

During a remarkable career spaning eight decades, he has sold over 100 million albums, hosted a hugely successful TV show and worked with a roll-call of showbusiness legends that included Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, Lauren Bacall, Elvis Presley and John Lennon. Now for the first time Andy tells the whole remarkable story. An Iowa farm boy who grew up during the Great Depression, Andy began performing at the age of seven as one quarter of the Williams Brothers. After going solo, he endured his wilderness years, barely scraping a living in 'rust-belt' supper clubs - to re-emerge as one of the greatest television and recording stars of his era. The Andy Williams Show topped TV ratings around the world, and a string of smash hits, including his signature tune Moon River, went on to earn him eighteen gold and three platinum discs. Still singing, still holding audiences in the palm of his hand, Andy Williams looks back on an extraordinary showbusiness life.

1339,Love in America: Autobiography Volume III (1919-1922),"When Julian Green first set foot in New York in 1919 he felt it would have been better to die than to leave his beloved France. Although an American, he was Parisian born and bred and still immersed in memories of the war and of his dead mother. Recondite, proud and acutely sensitive, this devout young Catholic was exiled from his country, his language and his religion. But from the moment he arrives in Charlottesville, where he is to spend three years studying at the University of Virginia, Green begins to feel more at peace. For he is in the South, the land of his parents; a land haunted by family shadows, by his mother's teachings of the tragic history of the Civil War and her memories of a place 'where roses bloom in the heart of winter'. Part of him had come home. Beneath the sycamores and the gleaming white colonnades of a campus designed by Thomas Jefferson, this highly impressionable and unworldy youth is initiated into the beauties of the classics and the language of Shakespeare. But human beauty also makes its mark, and Green's early éducation sentimentale is both passionate and painful. Wanting to become a priest, his experiences in America engage him in a profound and obsessive battle between the desires of the flesh and his own zealous dedication to the spirit. He describes with eloquence and honest how he gradually realizes that he is not alone; how he comes to accept the true nature of his sexual identity and, at last, allows himself to fall in love. He also comes to terms with the Yankees -- who he initially thought of as 'barbarians' -- and with the South, a landscape that had filled his imagination from an early age and which went on to have a lasting and tangible influence on his career as a writer. Over sixty years later in The Distant Lands and The Stars of the South , Green's epic novels of the South before and during the Civil War, he recreates the splendour of his Uncle Will's home, 'The Lawn', where he spend many of his vacations from university. Altogether, a dozen of Green's books, including his play South and his classics novels Moira and Each Man in his Darkness , are set in America.",0714529877,9780714529875,285,Julien Green,Euan Cameron, ,3.88,8,1,Marion Boyars Publishers,1994,Hardcover,English,2199-818549.Love_in_America.html

1342,The Green Paradise: Autobiography Volume 1 (1900-1916),"Autobiography, confession of adolescence, an exercise in the art of evoking past experiences ... Julian Green's memories of his childhood are full of many fascinations. When he was born in 1900, the century was itself just beginning. Green's description of a happy family life reaches back to the American South in the 19th century and deep inside his burgeoning self, which he analyzes with amazing objectivity. The main factors in the author's development are his creativity, his conversion to Catholicism and his nascent sexuality. Julian Green's determination to 'say everything' is impressive.

1350,Arc of the Arrow: Writing Your Spiritual Autobiography,"More and more, we are coming to realize that, along with our bodies, we have souls -- eternal, immaterial essences that accompany us throughout life. From birth to death, while our bodies drive themselves, our minds learn and plan, and our hearts experience love, joy, pain and loss, our souls are alive too, and at work -- though the nature and scope of that work may not always be apparent.

1357,"Autobiography and Selected Letters, Volume I: Autobiography. Letters 1-50 (Loeb Classical Library No. 478)","A professing pagan in an aggressively Christian empire, a friend of the emperor Julian and acquaintance of St. Basil, a potent spokesman for private and political causes--Libanius can tell us much about the tumultuous world of the fourth century. Born in Antioch to a wealthy family steeped in the culture and religious traditions of Hellenism, Libanius rose to fame as a teacher of the classics in a period of rapid social change. In his lifetime Libanius was an acknowledged master of the art of letter writing. Today his letters--about 1550 of which survive--offer an enthralling self-portrait of this combative pagan publicist and a vivid picture of the culture and political intrigues of the eastern empire. A. F. Norman selects one eighth of the extant letters, which come from two periods in Libanius's life, 355-365 and 388-393 CE, letters written to Julian, churchmen, civil officials, scholars, and his many influential friends. The ""Letters"" are complemented, in this two-volume edition, by Libanius's ""Autobiography"" (""Oration"" 1), a revealing narrative that begins as a scholar's account and ends as an old man's private journal.

The verification had been undertaken through direct memory of past lives, using Regression Therapy and Channeled sources. The purpose was not to demean established teachings, teachings that have almost two thousand years of tradition to back them up. I simply wanted to put forward what I personally believe to be true, with regard to the human being we all refer to as Jesus of Nazareth. Once there was an extraordinary man who walked this planet. He was the paradigm for all that Humankind can become. He spoke simply so that all could understand. His fundamental teaching was that everyone can come to God ONLY through the Heart Center. ""As I do, you also can do"" he said. His words were literal then, they have become lost in Institutionalized metaphysics. He did not arrive on the political stage of first century Judea without having first undergone extensive training and unimagined personal dangers. It is this training and the many inconsistencies of the New Testament that this novel addresses and explains. You cannot know the man - until you know his background.

This is the story of an ordinary woman precariously balanced between the very strong pull of her American, mid-western upbringing and the relentless hunger of her own unique spiritual intuition. Following her into the unpredictable twists and turns of her sometimes reluctant, but always expanding, relationship with her remarkable spiritual Teacher is both unnerving and exhilarating. Sharon's candor and humor lured me, the reader, into becoming, first, a secret witness and, gradually, a trusted confidant whom she led ever deeper into the adventure of her own metamorphosis. By the time I reached Sharon's stunning conclusion, I had glimpsed a range of human consciousness potential, not only within her but also within myself, that was different from anything I had previously imagined. My heart had been both inspired and chastened. In a simple yet startling way, INITIATION reveals the story of the divine spark that struggles to awaken within each of us.

He took possession of United's left wing and never loosened his grip. Over a fourteen year career so far, he's seen them all come and go: Cantona, Schmeichel, Beckham and the rest. Sir Alex Ferguson said of Giggs 'I knew we had an outstanding talent when we gave him his debut.' That was back in 1991, but it remains as true in 2005 as it ever was.

1363,But for the Grace of God: An Autobiography of an Aviator and Astronaut,"But for the Grace of God is not just the autobiography of astronaut and aviator, William R. ""Bill"" Pogue. ""Competently and directly, he guides the reader through a half-century of technological advance."" says Mike Collins, Command Module Pilot, Apollo11. The book has already received rave reviews from experts and enthusiasts. Ed Gibson, fellow Skylab 4 crewmember and science pilot says it best: ""In his humble yet factual way, Bill Pogue describes the crucible in which he was raised, lived, and worked -- the crucible that made him an exceptional man and one of our nation's finest aviators and astronauts. The honesty and work ethic of country life, love of flying, stresses of being a fighter pilot in the Korean War, demands on a Thunderbird pilot, and challenges of a test pilot all prepared him for his lead role on Skylab, America's first space station. Alan Bean, Apollo 12 Astronaut and Fourth Man to Set Foot on the Moon, called Bill one of the astronauts he admired most during his eighteen-year career at NASA. He says, ""But for the Grace of God will serve as a life-changing inspiration for many. It is a must read for anyone interested in space exploration."" ""But for the Grace of God is one of the two best memoirs ever written by an astronaut and should be required reading for every pilot or astronaut aspirant. In his book, Pogue packages his adventure-filled life into easy-to-read, inspiring tales that move swiftly from page to page. They are filled with his reverence for his family, God, nature, and mankind. Whether engaging the enemy in combat, flying metal-bending aerobatics with the Thunderbirds, or setting all records for distance and endurance in the wonderful Skylab (a true space station of its time), Pogue speaks clearly with compelling authority but a modest tone. This is a keeper -- a book all parents should provide their children as a guide to how good life can be when it is lived to its fullest,"" says Walter J. Boyne Author/Historian; Former Director, National Air & Space Museum; and Enshrinee, National Aviation Hall of Fame. Ed Buckbee, NASA Public Affairs for Wernher von Braun and Founder, U. S. Space Camp calls Bill Pogue, .."". a country boy from the heartland of America who surpassed his wildest dreams as an aviator, combat fighter pilot, elite Thunderbird pilot, and a member of the brotherhood of astronauts who maintained an even strain and went higher, faster, and farther -- eighty-four days on orbit aboard Skylab. It makes me proud to know this country can produce such patriots, aviators, and space explorers. We only made a few. Bill Pogue was one."" Finally, Skylab 4 Commander Jerry Carr adds, ""Reading Bill Pogue's autobiography has been a real adventure for me. We have known each other for 45 years (since we were selected as astronauts by NASA), and we have been close the whole time. His upbringing parallels mine to some degree and brought back a flood of old memories. He is a superb writer who has lived a very special life. Now, he is sharing that life with all of us, and I, for one, am grateful. He is a great pilot, an excellent astronaut, and outstanding representative of our nation.

1367,The Autobiography of Ashley Bowen (1728-1813),"The first American sailor known to write his own autobiography, Ashley Bowen remains a valuable storyteller who can speak to today's readers about the maritime world in the age of sail. Ashley Bowen began his seafaring career at the age of eleven. After leaving the sea, Bowen spent the rest of his days as a ship-rigger in Marblehead, Massachusetts.

Vickers' introduction provides the context for Bowen's life in colonial New England, and additional writings by Ashley Bowen and his Marblehead contemporaries are included.

1378,The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years,"This novel is the cumulative work of almost twenty years. The material has been researched extensively, both through academic sources and in the countries of Israel, India and Egypt. The verification had been undertaken through direct memory of past lives, using Regression Therapy and Channeled sources. The purpose was not to demean established teachings, teachings that have almost two thousand years of tradition to back them up. I simply wanted to put forward what I personally believe to be true, with regard to the human being we all refer to as Jesus of Nazareth. Once there was an extraordinary man who walked this planet. He was the paradigm for all that Humankind can become. He spoke simply so that all could understand. His fundamental teaching was that everyone can come to God ONLY through the Heart Center. ""As I do, you also can do"" he said. His words were literal then, they have become lost in Institutionalized metaphysics. He did not arrive on the political stage of first century Judea without having first undergone extensive training and unimagined personal dangers. It is this training and the many inconsistencies of the New Testament that this novel addresses and explains. You cannot know the man - until you know his background. This background has been kept secret for two thousand years, for reasons that will become quickly evident.",0968243703,9780968243701,250,Richard G.

1380,Initiation: Autobiography of a Shaman-Buddhist Apprentice,"Reading INITIATION by Sharon Shier was a mind-boggling surprise! This is no pious recital of religious platitudes. This is the story of an ordinary woman precariously balanced between the very strong pull of her American, mid-western upbringing and the relentless hunger of her own unique spiritual intuition. Following her into the unpredictable twists and turns of her sometimes reluctant, but always expanding, relationship with her remarkable spiritual Teacher is both unnerving and exhilarating. Sharon's candor and humor lured me, the reader, into becoming, first, a secret witness and, gradually, a trusted confidant whom she led ever deeper into the adventure of her own metamorphosis. By the time I reached Sharon's stunning conclusion, I had glimpsed a range of human consciousness potential, not only within her but also within myself, that was different from anything I had previously imagined. My heart had been both inspired and chastened. In a simple yet startling way, INITIATION reveals the story of the divine spark that struggles to awaken within each of us. As such, it has the elements of both an intriguing mystery and an unfolding love story of a very high order.",0932927203,9780932927200,450,Sharon Shier, , ,3.80,5,0,Higher Consciousness Books,October 28th 2004,Paperback, ,2236-401182.Initiation.html
1381,But for the Grace of God: An Autobiography of an Aviator and Astronaut,"But for the Grace of God is not just the autobiography of astronaut and aviator, William R. ""Bill"" Pogue. ""Competently and directly, he guides the reader through a half-century of technological advance."" says Mike Collins, Command Module Pilot, Apollo11. The book has already received rave reviews from experts and enthusiasts. Ed Gibson, fellow Skylab 4 crewmember and science pilot says it best: ""In his humble yet factual way, Bill Pogue describes the crucible in which he was raised, lived, and worked -- the crucible that made him an exceptional man and one of our nation's finest aviators and astronauts. The honesty and work ethic of country life, love of flying, stresses of being a fighter pilot in the Korean War, demands on a Thunderbird pilot, and challenges of a test pilot all prepared him for his lead role on Skylab, America's first space station. Alan Bean, Apollo 12 Astronaut and Fourth Man to Set Foot on the Moon, called Bill one of the astronauts he admired most during his eighteen-year career at NASA. He says, ""But for the Grace of God will serve as a life-changing inspiration for many. It is a must read for anyone interested in space exploration."" ""But for the Grace of God is one of the two best memoirs ever written by an astronaut and should be required reading for every pilot or astronaut aspirant. In his book, Pogue packages his adventure-filled life into easy-to-read, inspiring tales that move swiftly from page to page. They are filled with his reverence for his family, God, nature, and mankind. Whether engaging the enemy in combat, flying metal-bending aerobatics with the Thunderbirds, or setting all records for distance and endurance in the wonderful Skylab (a true space station of its time), Pogue speaks clearly with compelling authority but a modest tone. This is a keeper -- a book all parents should provide their children as a guide to how good life can be when it is lived to its fullest,"" says Walter J. Boyne Author/Historian; Former Director, National Air & Space Museum; and Enshrinee, National Aviation Hall of Fame. Ed Buckbee, NASA Public Affairs for Wernher von Braun and Founder, U. S. Space Camp calls Bill Pogue, .."". a country boy from the heartland of America who surpassed his wildest dreams as an aviator, combat fighter pilot, elite Thunderbird pilot, and a member of the brotherhood of astronauts who maintained an even strain and went higher, faster, and farther -- eighty-four days on orbit aboard Skylab. It makes me proud to know this country can produce such patriots, aviators, and space explorers. We only made a few. Bill Pogue was one."" Finally, Skylab 4 Commander Jerry Carr adds, ""Reading Bill Pogue's autobiography has been a real adventure for me. We have known each other for 45 years (since we were selected as astronauts by NASA), and we have been close the whole time. His upbringing parallels mine to some degree and brought back a flood of old memories. He is a superb writer who has lived a very special life. Now, he is sharing that life with all of us, and I, for one, am grateful. He is a great pilot, an excellent astronaut, and outstanding representative of our nation. I am proud to be his friend and colleague.""",0981475655,9780981475653,358,William R.

1382,Naked Through the Gate: A Spiritual Autobiography,"In this dramatic and engaging spiritual autobiography, Joel Morwood (now the spiritual director at the Center for Sacred Sciences in Eugene, Oregon) candidly shares the struggles and insights of his remarkable journey to spiritual Awakening. After his failed attempts to find lasting happiness as a revolutionary in the 60s and a Hollywood producer in the 70s, Joel finally turns to a spiritual path. Assisted by his study of the mystical classics from diverse religious traditions, and guided by his own numinous dreams, Joel discovers the fundamental principles of the spiritual path (attention, commitment, detachment, and surrender) and shows us how he puts them into practice in the concrete situations of his life. Having tested the teachings of the mystics in his own experience, he ultimately finds these practices have stripped him naked of all attachment, including even his striving for spiritual attainment. Then, out of this dark night of the spirit dawns the profound spiritual Awakening to Ultimate Reality. Joel's story is both a modern testimony to the universal truth taught by the mystics of all the religions, and an inspirational example illustrating how to put spiritual principles into practice in our own lives.",0962038709,9780962038709,262,Joel Morwood, , ,4.25,4,1,Center for Sacred Sciences,May 1st 1988,Paperback, ,2238-3884679-naked-through-the-gate.html

Early on he also acquired a taste for reading and became a ""library bum"", hitting the stacks in the towns he tramped through. He loved Dumas and Dickens, but he above all sought to follow the example of Jack London and Maxim Gorky, two other road-kids who made it out of the tramp world through writing.

Now 104, she began her political life at the age of five, when her father, John Francis Fitzgerald, was elected to Congress; he later became mayor of Boston. In their warm foreword to this reissue, Rose's children?Edward Kennedy, Eunice Shriver, Patricia Lawford, Jean Smith?call her ""the best politician in our family,"" and indeed, she relives her prominent role in accompanying her husband, Joseph Kennedy, FDR's ambassador to the Court of St. James, to Great Britain as war clouds gathered over Europe, and her vigorous campaigning for her sons, John and Bobby, in 1960 and 1968. Strewn with quotes from letters, diaries and recollections by family members and Kennedy watchers, this conversational, unpretentious memoir is particularly interesting when Rose is discussing JFK's illnesses and injuries, raising her nine children, her mentally retarded daughter, Rosemary, and the deep religious faith that sustained her through personal tragedies.

1407,Zig: The Autobiography of Zig Ziglar,"""Zig Ziglar epitomizes determination, perseverance, excellence, and a loving Christian spirit more than anyone I know! The world would be a better place if more of us were just like him."" --Kenneth H. Cooper, M.D., The Cooper Clinic, Dallas, Texas Zig Ziglar, the motivational speaker who has galvanized audiences around the world and written more than a dozen perennially popular books, brings that same unbounded energy and clarity of vision to this candid, inspiring account of his own life and the forces that shaped it. Every year, Zig Ziglar travels all over the world delivering a resounding message of hope and commitment in forums ranging from high-powered business conferences and church leadership assemblies to youth conventions and educational gatherings. In Zig , Ziglar chronicles another kind of journey: his own transformation from a struggling, not terribly successful salesman to the sales champion of several different companies, and finally to his current position as one of the world's best-known and most highly regarded motivational speakers and trainers. As he describes his experiences, he brings to life the essence of his teachings: “You can have everything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want.” At the heart of Ziglar's story are the people who taught him the importance of balancing a commitment to hard work with compassion for others. His first teacher was his mother, who raised him alone after the early death of his father, and introduced him to the principles and values he has honored for the rest of his life. Her lessons were reinforced by many others–from the men and women who became his business mentors to the friends and spiritual leaders who comforted and supported him when things got tough. Paying tribute to each of them, Ziglar zeroes in on the philosophy and traits that have enabled him to achieve success in business and in his personal life: discipline, hard work, common sense, integrity, commitment, and an infectious sense of humor. Ziglar's speaking engagements and seminars along with a wide array of audio and video materials, books, and training manuals, have helped to trigger positive changes in small businesses, Fortune 500 companies, U.S. government agencies, nonprofit associations, religious organizations, schools, and prisons. At once engaging and enlightening, Zig provides a riveting portrait of the man who has achieved so much by embracing the simple but profound goal of helping others.

1410,The German Worker: Working-Class Autobiographies from the Age of Industrialization,"In the two generations before World War I, Germany emerged as Europe's foremost industrial power. The basic facts of increasing industrial output, lengthening railroad lines, urbanization, and rising exports are well known. Behind those facts, in the historical shadows, stand millions of anonymous men and women: the workers who actually put down the railroad ties, hacked out the coal, sewed the shirt collars, printed the books, or carried the bricks that made Germany a great nation. This book contains translated selections from the autobiographies of nineteen of those now-forgotten millions. The thirteen men and six women who speak from these pages afford an intimate firsthand look at how massive social and economic changes are reflected on a personal level in the everyday lives of workers. Although some of these autobiographies are familiar to specialists in German labor history, they are virtually unknown and inaccessible to the broader audience they deserve. This book provides translations that are at once useful, interesting, and entertaining to a wide range of historians, students, and general readers.",0520061241,9780520061248,350,Alfred H.

1418,Reaching for the Beaufort Sea: An Autobiography,"Long known to insiders as one of the most unique personalities in Canadian letters, the celebrated poet Al Purdy begins this story of his life by noting that just as he was about to be born his hometown of Trenton was flattened by a historic explosion as the local munitions factory, ""no doubt accounting for any oddity and eccentricity in my character."" By the time the readers realize just how much there is to account for, they may be forgiven for wondering if the Trenton Blast was big enough to do the job. ""Reaching for the Beaufort Sea"" is one of the most engaging and revealing autobiographies ever undertaken by a leading Canadian author. Writing in a relaxed, conversational style with ribald humour never far below the surface, Purdy shows himself no mercy as he exposes what surely must be one of the most unlikely literary apprenticeships ever served. He is equally merciless when it comes to providing uncensored glimpses of writers like Margaret Atwood, Margaret Laurence, F.R. Scott, Earle Birney, Louis Dudek, Irving Layton, Hugh MacLennan, Leonard Cohen, and John Newlove, who worked, loved and brawled alongside Purdy during Canadian literature's coming of age. Gossipy and lighthearted as it is at times, ""Reaching for the Beaufort Sea"" nevertheless makes an important contribution to the understanding of modern Canadian letters, and is essential reading for anyone hoping to appreciate fully a writer Dennis Lee has called ""one of the substantial poets in English of the century.""",1550170880,9781550170887,296,Al Purdy, , ,4.00,3,0,Harbour Publishing,January 1st 1993,Hardcover,English,2270-160824.Reaching_for_the_Beaufort_Sea.html

Car racer, car collector and all-round car enthusiast, Johnson is an incurable, certifiable petrolhead who can't remember a time when four wheels didn't feature as large in his life as music. Starting, as a young boy growing up in Tyneside, with an old steering wheel and his imagination, a lifelong passion took root early.And through cramped teenage fumbles in an old mini and clapped-out, hygienically challenged tour vans, to chauffeur-driven, leather-trimmed limos and a sideline as a successful racing driver, it's been there ever since. By turns, surprising, joyful, poignant and usually laugh-out-loud funny, Rockers and Rollers is the story of man with an insatiable appetite for life and a glimpse into the extraordinary world of AC/DC, set soon to overtake the Beatles as the biggest selling-band in history.

1425,An Autobiography of General Custer,"Taken from George Armstrong Custer's own writings, An Autobiography of General Custer is the “true story” of one of the most praised, most despised, but surely most remembered American military heroes. Indeed, few figures in our history were—in their own time, as well as in our own—so wildly cheered and so roundly hated. Custer’s narration takes us from just after the Civil War, when, having gained a reputation as a bold and inventive leader of the cavalry, Custer was given command of an expedition to help subjugate the Native Peoples of the Great Plains and to force them onto reservations. His story touches on his own court martial and subsequent reinstatement to command. It ends shortly before he embarks upon the campaign that would eventually lead to the Battle of the Little Bighorn and “Custer’s Last Stand.” As Custer was unable to write about his most famous battle, the Autobiography concludes with an 1880s newspaper account of an interview with Sitting Bull himself after his escape to Canada, in which the great Chief looks back on the battle and offers his own point of view. In the evenings, on post and during his various leaves, Custer would sit at the dining room table with his beloved wife, Libby, and together they would compose the various stories of his exploits that would eventually become the book My Life on the Plains , which was a bestseller in its time, and from which this autobiography is largely taken.",1620870754,9781620870754,256,Stephen  Brennan, , ,2.67,3,1,Skyhorse Publishing,October 1st 2012,Hardcover,English,2277-14603006-an-autobiography-of-general-custer.html

Born in Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily, Bonnano found his future amid the whiskey-running, riotous streets of Prohibition America in 1924, when he illegally entered the United States to pursue his dreams. By the age of only twenty-six, Bonnano became a Don. He would eventually take over the New York underworld, igniting the ""Castellammarese War,"" one of the bloodiest Family battles ever to hit New York City... Now, in this candid and stunning memoir, Joe Bonanno-likely a model for Don Corleone in the blockbuster movie The Godfather-takes readers inside the world of the real Mafia.

Indeed, few figures in our history were—in their own time, as well as in our own—so wildly cheered and so roundly hated. Custer’s narration takes us from just after the Civil War, when, having gained a reputation as a bold and inventive leader of the cavalry, Custer was given command of an expedition to help subjugate the Native Peoples of the Great Plains and to force them onto reservations. His story touches on his own court martial and subsequent reinstatement to command. It ends shortly before he embarks upon the campaign that would eventually lead to the Battle of the Little Bighorn and “Custer’s Last Stand.” As Custer was unable to write about his most famous battle, the Autobiography concludes with an 1880s newspaper account of an interview with Sitting Bull himself after his escape to Canada, in which the great Chief looks back on the battle and offers his own point of view. In the evenings, on post and during his various leaves, Custer would sit at the dining room table with his beloved wife, Libby, and together they would compose the various stories of his exploits that would eventually become the book My Life on the Plains , which was a bestseller in its time, and from which this autobiography is largely taken.",1620870754,9781620870754,256,Stephen  Brennan, , ,2.67,3,1,Skyhorse Publishing,October 1st 2012,Hardcover,English,2281-14603006-an-autobiography-of-general-custer.html

The Autobiography of Lady Lawford,"This is an oral autobiography of Lady May Lawford, mother of actor Peter Lawford, as told to and transcribed by Buddy Galon: “I felt Peter was awfully mean to Marilyn. After all, on the evening that she died she had called him on the telephone and had said goodbye to everyone there at his beach house. Then she dropped the telephone as a result of her loss of consciousness. Peter had run to her rescue before (just as he had with Judy Garland) when she pleaded over the phone for him to come over. However, this time was different because she said ‘goodbye’. ‘Goodbye’ sounded final. “’How could you be so unfeeling when that lovely girl’s life was at stake?’ I asked Peter when I finally managed to get though to him.”",, ,176,Lady May Lawford,Adolph Caso,Buddy Gallon,2.25,4,1, , ,Kindle Edition,English,2285-6687172-bitch-the-autobiography-of-lady-lawford.html

1440,The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,"Printer and publisher, author and educator, scientist and inventor, statesman and philanthropist, Benjamin Franklin was the very embodiment of the American type of self-made man. In 1771, at the age of 65, he sat down to write his autobiography, ""having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born and bred to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the world, and having gone so far through life with a considerable share of felicity."" The result is a classic of American literature. On the eve of the tercentenary of Franklin's birth, the university he founded has selected the Autobiography for the Penn Reading Project. Each year, for the past fifteen years, the University of Pennsylvania has chosen a single work that the entire incoming class, and a large segment of the faculty and staff, read and discuss together. For this occasion the University of Pennsylvania Press will publish a special edition of Franklin's Autobiography , including a new preface by University president Amy Gutmann and an introduction by distinguished scholar Peter Conn. The volume will also include four short essays by noted Penn professors as well as a chronology of Franklin's life and the text of Franklin's Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania , a document resulting in the establishment of an institution of higher education that ultimately became the University of Pennsylvania. No area of human endeavor escaped Franklin's keen attentions. His ideas and values, as Amy Gutmann notes in her remarks, have shaped the modern University of Pennsylvania profoundly, ""more profoundly than have the founders of any other major university of college in the United States."" Franklin believed that he had been born too soon. Readers will recognize that his spirit lives on at Penn today. Essay contributors: Richard R.

1444,Darren Lockyer Autobiography,"The updated edition of the Rugby League superstar's end-of-career autobiography. In 2011, NRL fans had the chance to share in a piece of rugby league history. The game's record books were re-written, some taken to heights unlikely to ever be matched. Darren Lockyer celebrated his 34th birthday in 2011. Of those 34 years, 17 have been spent putting his body through hell in perhaps the toughest football competition on the planet. Lockyer has, quite literally, spent half his lifetime in the NRL. Lockyer holds the all-time appearance record for club, state and country. It is a feat no less a judge than Wayne Bennett declared would never be equalled. The remarkable longevity of Lockyer's excellence has earned him the respect of fellow athletes around the world and the adoration of fans everywhere. But while undoubtedly one of the most recognisable athletes in Australia, Lockyer has largely maintained his privacy, rarely, if ever, allowing fans a look at the man behind the man. In this book Lockyer, for the first time, opens up on the people, places, incidents and events which have shaped the life and career of an Australian sporting icon. From his days growing up and working at the family-owned truck stop on the outskirts of the tiny Queensland town of Wandoan, to his arrival at the Broncos as a teenage sensation and subsequent ascension toward rugby league immortality the book will shed new light on some of the biggest names and stories of the past two decades. Contributions from Lockyer's family and friends, as well as legendary figures like Wayne Bennett, Wendell Sailor, Andrew Johns, Mal Meninga, Johnathan Thurston, Gorden Tallis, George Gregan, Ricky Stuart and Craig Bellamy gives this book a unique edge, with each providing readers a rare insight into their view on Lockyer the player, the leader and the man.",, ,400,Darren Lockyer, , ,3.50,4,0,Random House Australia,September 1st 2011,Kindle Edition,English,2294-19822090-darren-lockyer-autobiography.html
1445,Amazing Grace: Autobiography of a Survivor,"At eighteen this rebel street kid found herself in Federal prison for stealing a car. When a new program gave her the chance for an outside day job while still in prison, she took it...along with the opportunity for clandestine lovemaking in a cheap hotel with fellow prisoner. She was caught, stripped of her privileges. She also was pregnant. That brought a parole and a devastating betrayal-the price of her freedom was giving up her unborn child for adoption. Out of prison, she plunged into the heady world of radical antiwar politics, playing and partying through the wild world of the late sixties in San Francisco. Until recurring headaches drove her to seek medical help. ""Sorry, we can't find any tumors,"" they said. ""However, you are going blind. Oh yes, it's incurable, irreversible, and hereditary."" She was twenty-three. She bore a second child, a son. He would probably go blind, too. That made her mad and changed her life. No, by God, he wouldn't go blind! This is the true story of Grace Halloran, a survivor, a person who gets things done against all odds. She tells how she, a blind mother, raised her son. She recounts the step-by-step process of intuition and serendipity that led to her developing unorthodox therapies which finally reversed her irreversible disease and reversed it in others, as well! What? The official scientific/medical commuity was incensed. How dare she! She tells about her growing reputation. She gave classes. People from all over the world came to her, and she went all over the world. Her stories of helping people to see again are poignant. One thing is clear: she loves these people. She cares, and passionately. But when she founded the Center for Eye Health Education in northern California, that was too much for the scientific/medical community. Who did this woman think she was? Reversing the irreversible! Political pressure led to the cancellation of the $100,000 grant from the State of California. The Center folded. But Grace didn't. Amazing Grace is the powerful story of one woman's courage and fierce determination to save her son and herself from blindness. Full of fun and gritty reality, it is an inspiring account of what determination in the face of overwhelming odds can do. It is also a story of personal triumph over helter-skelter beginnings, even to the final pages, when Grace discovers what happened to the daughter who was wrested from her and put up for adoption over twenty years before.",1880823055,9781880823057,292,Grace Halloran, , ,0.00,0,0,North Star Publications (MA),October 1st 1993,Paperback,English,2295-765194.Amazing_Grace.html

1447,Autobiography of Saint Therese,"Few spiritual figures have touched as many readers in the past century as Saint Therese of Lisieux, the saint popularly known as the Little Flower. Though she was only twenty-four years old when she died, her writings have had tremendous impact, making her one of the most popular spiritual writers in the twentieth century. Her autobiography, ""The Story of a Soul,"" has been a source of priceless inspiration ever since it was written, and has become the great spiritual bestseller of our time. A hundred years after her death in 1897, millions of copies have spread throughout the world and it has been translated into more than fifty languages. The reason for the continued success of her autobiography is, quite simply, that it is unlike any work of devotion and spiritual insight ever written. Once it is read, it cannot be forgotten. Its appeal across cultures and generations has been extensive, moving both peasants and popes, men and women, young and old -- people of every kind of intelligence and education succumb to its spell. Yet is not a conventional work of religious devotion; instead, it is in many ways a supernatural book. In the words of Pope Pius XI, Saint Therese ""attained the knowledge of supernatural things in such abundant measure that she was able to point out the sure way of salvation to others,"" and it is especially in ""The Story of a Soul"" that she has pointed out this sure way to the generations that have followed her. As Therese herself said of this book just prior to her death, ""What I have written will do a lot of good. It will make the kindness of God better known.""",1299111858,9781299111851,0,John Beevers, , ,5.00,2,1,Image,January 1st 2011,ebook, ,2297-18433038-autobiography-of-saint-therese.html

Living in the vivacious and eccentric community of New Hope, Pa, in the 1970s and 1980s, she very much reflected that town's character. Yet another place, Wales, the land of her forefathers, ever kept a spiritual hold on her, beckoning her homeward through the most unexpected of mechanisms (e.g. scents, strolls along a canal, animals, family and friends) until she discovers who she really is and the redemptive power of the cross. Her son, H. R. Jakes, a writer who lives in Texas, compiled her story. He has been writing all his life, and she thus felt confident to entrust him with that task. Through him, further books in this series will be forthcoming, first among them Curious Recipes: the Mostly Welsh Cookbook of Elaine Jakes, a charming (and tasty) combination of Elaine's tales with detailed recipes, featuring as an aspect of every vignette the story behind each culinary delight.

1466,"""Blackcat"" The Autobiography of a Feral Cat","""Blackcat"" had survived in a heavily forested area of the Pacific Northwest for some years, according to local residents who had noticed him occasionally venturing out into a clearing to bask in some rare rays of sunshine. He would flee if anyone approached, and it was obvious that he had never known the touch of a human hand, or even been close enough to know human voices. Coyotes lay in wait for him, and as he grew older the time would come when he would not be able to move fast enough to escape, destined to become part of the food chain. Cat lovers everywhere likely know of feral cats in their neighborhood but sadly, most people don't know how to deal with the problem. And no, even a formerly homeless kitty does not have to be subjected to the inhumane practice of ""declawing."" With a little training, (using a plant misting bottle of water if they attempt to scratch furniture, etc.), together with a good scratching post such as the cardboard, ""alpine"" type, cats soon learn where to scratch and what places to avoid. This kitty autobiography was written partly to chronicle the life of a little homeless cat who was lucky enough to become a special member of a human family, but also to carry some important messages that need to reach pet lovers everywhere. According to HSUS, approximately four million cats and dogs are euthanized annually in the United States. About one every eight seconds. Spaying/Neutering is essential if every domestic animal is to have a home. Secondly, we should be adopting our pets from shelters rather than breeders to try to reduce overpopulation. Thirdly, there is a world-wide misconception about ""feral"" cats - they are not necessarily ""wild"", and as in the case of ""Blackcat"", these kitties are only a generation away from the lap kitty who has always known human contact. In many cases, with loving patience they can be ""turned,"" only to become amazing pets. Where ""Blackcat's"" autobiography is donated to shelters, total costs of production will be borne by the author - in other cases, royalties will be donated to animal charities.",, ,42,Diana Maloney, , ,4.00,3,0,CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform,July 20th 2013,Kindle Edition,English,2314-19620175-blackcat-the-autobiography-of-a-feral-cat.html

This is the light-hearted and amusing life story of a larger-than-life character. A serious head injury forced Bill Beaumont to retire from rugby prematurely at the age of 29, after leading his country 21 times in 34 appearances - including a memorable grand slam in 1980 - and captaining the Lions to South Africa. Since then he has been honoured with an OBE and turned to a career in broadcasting as a BBC and Sky Sports summariser and, more famously, as captain on the sports quiz show A Question of Sport. He is also a raconteur and after-dinner speaker, and recently became chairman of the RFU's National Playing Committee. Bill Beaumont reflects back on a wonderful career, reliving the dramatic events on the field as well as the off-the-field scrapes and humorous escapades that characterized the game in its amateur era.",0007156693,9780007156696,384,Bill Beaumont,Geoff Green, ,4.00,2,0,McGraw-Hill/Osborne Media,January 10th 2003,Hardcover,English,2320-15091196-bill-beaumont.html

The public man is well known -- aggressive in battle, hard-line in politics -- but the private man has always been obscured by Sharon's dazzling career and powerful personality. In this compelling and dramatic auto-biography, the real Sharon appears for the first time: a complex man, a loving father, a figure of courage and compassion. He is a warrior who commands the respect and love of his troops, a visionary, and an uncompromising, ruthless pragmatist.

She was adorable, spoke with a potty mouth and carried on as if she was in her twenties. I was straining to approach her but backed off. I'd been in enough trouble. The next time I looked she was gone. A couple nights later she reappeared and in the same spot at the middle of the bar, entertaining the bartender. I pulled the trigger this time, and whatever I had to say she bought.' ""I'm eating your book! It's delicious!"" Lia Mack - Portland, Oregon ""Fervent shades of Jack Kerouac."" Terry Wells - Brigg, England ""Lords of the Sunset Strip"" is the brutally honest and hilarious memoir of actor and writer Blackie Dammett-AKA John Kiedis-who happens to be the father of Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis. Set mostly in Hollywood but with multiple national and worldwide excursions for film shoots, love affairs and drug deals, this tell-all provides an unexpectedly candid look at an actor's transition from a wild man with a dream to a sensitive if unconventional parent with a dream. And of course, there were the women. New girls were always replenishing the scene. Dammett towed his young Red Hot Chili Pepper with him through a torrent of sex-fueled parties, auditions and business deals in Hollywood, New York and London. It's an exhilarating, exhausting and romantic journey. It had a profound and ineffable influence on Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Anthony.

1501,The Autobiography of Elder Joseph Bates,"This historic book may have numerous typos, missing text, images, or index. Purchasers can download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. 1868. Not illustrated. Excerpt: ... command of the Lord to his confiding and disappointed people, at this particular point of the Second-advent movement, was to Wait."" Midnight Cry--First Angel's Message--The Ten Virgins--Second Disappointment--Three Angel's Messages-- The Sabbath--Progress of the Work--Conclusion. The first work of the Advent body in their disappointment was to re-examine the 2300 days of Daniel's vision. But they were unable to discover any error in their calculation. It was still evident and clear that it required every day of 457 years before Christ, and also every day of 1843 years after Christ to complete the 2300 years of the vision, on which the Advent movement started from 1840. It was also clear that the year must correspond and terminate with the Jewish sacred year. At this important crisis, the ""Advent Shield,"" was published, reviewing all the past movement, especially the prophetic periods, showing that we had followed them down correctly. We quote from Vol. i, No. 1, p. 87. "" Wc look upon the proclamation which has been made, as being the cry of the angel who proclaimed, ' The hour of his judgment is come.' (Rev. xiv, 6, 7.) It is the sound which is to reach all nations; it is the proclamation of the everlasting gospel. In one shape or other this cry has gone abroad through the earth, wherever human beings are found, and we have had opportunity to hear of the fact."" ""Joseph Wolfe, D. D., according to his journals, between the years 1821 and 1845, proclaimed the Lord's speedy advent, in Palestine, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, Georgia, throughout the Ottoman empire, in Greece, Arabia, Turkistan, HindoStan, in Holland, Scotland and Ireland, at Constantinople, Jerusalem, St. Helena, and in New York city to all denominations,"" &c, &c.-- Voice of the Church, pp. 3...",1150308486,9781150308482,166,Joseph Bates, , ,5.00,1,1,General Books,January 9th 2012,Paperback,English,2346-11328731-the-autobiography-of-elder-joseph-bates.html

Katz has always steeped himself in the literature of his time, having often painted and collaborated with poets, and it is no surprise that his take on autobiography should be particularly considered and original in its composition: the entire text of ""Invented Symbols"" is in fact a transcription of the artist recounting his memories aloud, typed up by his son, poet Vincent Katz.

In his autobiography, the author of No Room for Bears also writes a loving biography of the rough, beautiful, and exciting place that was Alaska in the 1920's and 30's. The book is filled with spell-binding ""descriptions of primitive Eskimos, of dog-sledding over the Bering ice, of sour-doughs he knew along the Yukon, of caribou and mountain goats and bears, of the old Alaska which will never be again."" The quote is from Corey Ford, and Mr. Ford continues: ""Certainly no man had a better first-hand knowledge of Alaska's birds and fishes and animals ...Frank Dufresne had a fantastic memory, a keen eye...a boundless excitement over each new discovery...

1511,Alan Bristow: Helicopter Pioneer: The Autobiography,"Alan Bristow, founder of Bristow Helicopters, died on April 26, 2009, seven days after completing his autobiography. He was a truly remarkable man; his full-page obituary was published in The Times and The Daily Telegraph. As a merchant navy officer cadet during the war Bristow survived two sinkings, played a part in the evacuation of Rangoon and was credited with shooting down two Stukas in North Africa. He joined the Fleet Air Arm and trained as one of the first British helicopter pilots, he was the first man to land a helicopter on a battleship and became Westland's first helicopter test pilot. Sacked for knocking out the sales manager, he flew in France, Holland, Algeria, Senegal and elsewhere, narrowly escaping many helicopter crashes before winning the Croix de Guerre evacuating wounded French soldiers in Indochina. For four years he flew for Aristotle Onassis's pirate whaling fleet in Antarctica before joining Douglas Bader and providing support services to oil drillers in the Persian Gulf. Out of that grew Bristow Helicopters Ltd, the largest helicopter company in the world outside AmericaBristow's circle included the great helicopter pioneers such as Igor Sikorsky and Stan Hiller, test pilots like Harold Penrose and Bill Waterton, Sheiks and Shahs and political leaders, business giants like Lord Cayzer and Freddie Laker - with whom he tossed a coin for 67,000 in 1969 - and the author James Clavell, a lifelong friend whose book 'Whirlwind' was a fictionalized account of Bristow's overnight evacuation of his people and helicopters from revolutionary Iran. Bristow represented Great Britain at four in hand carriage driving with the Duke of Edinburgh and precipitated the 'Westland Affair' when he made a takeover bid which eventually led to the resignation of Michael Heseltine and Leon Brittain, and almost to the downfall of Margaret Thatcher.",1848842082,9781848842083,384,Alan Bristow,Patrick Malone, ,4.50,4,0,Pen & Sword Aviation,March 1st 2010,Hardcover,English,2355-11068051-alan-bristow.html

In Nothing Like a Dame , Elaine reflects on a 50-year journey that took her to the peak of the entertainment world. She recounts her long struggle to make it in a male-dominated, working-class society when women were supposed to just shut up and stay thin, especially in the sexist worlds of theater and television, where she was told, ""Look, women just aren't funny."" Despite many highs and lows, she proceeded to forge a stellar career in show business, hosting her own TV series and becoming a household name thanks to her comic portrayal of Mary Nesbitt, the long-suffering wife in the award-winning BBC comedy Rab C.

1523,Not Dead Yet : the Unauthorized Autobiography of Dr. Robert Buckman,"""In case you were wondering, the title of this book is taken from a brief telephone conversation I had in 1980 with a man in the Contracts Department of the radio section of the British Broadcasting Corporation. Having recovered -- eventually and partially -- from dermatomyositis, I picked up the threads of my performing career with a radio series that had been arranged before I became ill. The man in the Contracts Department was terribly apologetic. 'I'm sorry I didn't get the contracts to you,' he said, 'I thought you were dead.' I was mildly surprised -- mostly that an event as minor as a death could affect the stately progress of BBC paperwork. 'Um, ... well ...,' I said, not wishing to overstate my case, 'not yet.' The paperwork arrived two days later."" Dr. Robert Buckman is well known on both sides of the Atlantic as a television presenter of medical topics, a best-selling author, a cancer physician and (occasionally) an entertainer. In this unusual autobiography, he tells the story of his life so far; as an exceptionally small child, a young physician, a performer (appearing on stage with the Monty Python crew), columnist, and author. What makes this book even more intriguing is that he has also been a patient -- suffering a near-fatal auto-immune disease in 1979 and an inflammation of the spinal cord ten years later which has left him partially paralyzed. In these pages, Dr. Buckman deals unflinchingly with medicine, health, theatre, sex, love, television, alcohol, money, telephones, flatulence, filing systems and a few other minor details of modern life. Not Dead Yet is often funny, sometimes hilarious, occasionally serious and always engaging.",0385256647,9780385256643,237,Robert Buckman, , ,3.62,8,0,Doubleday Canada,April 20th 1999,Unknown Binding,English,2366-495249.Not_Dead_Yet_.html

Here he met legendary comic actor Alastair Sim who, with his wife, took him as an evacuee in their country house and coached him in the finer skills of acting. A flurry of films and theatre performances in the late 1940s, after his RAF service, culminated in a memorable role as a young Ebenezer Scrooge in the classic 1951 film Scrooge alongside Sim. Henry V, Cleopatra (with Elizabeth Taylor), DonOCOt Forget to Write, Blott on the Landscape, Henry Root, and Dad are among other titles for which he is well known. But it was in 1979 that he landed the role that would elevate him to international recognition when he was offered the role of Arthur Daley in Thames TelevisionOCOs new series Minder alongside Dennis Waterman. In The World was my Lobster, a title taken from a classic line in a Minder episode, George Cole talks candidly, humorously and sensitively about his adoption, his life, his roles and many of the people he has worked with throughout his long career.""",1782198180,9781782198185,416,George Cole,Brian Hawkins, ,3.00,13,3,Not Avail,May 28th 2014,ebook,English,2367-18878781-george-cole---the-world-was-my-lobster.html

1526,Apprenticed to a Himalayan Master: A Yogi's Autobiography (Gujarati),"Language: Gujarati This ebook will render on Kindle Reader for PC/ Kindle Fire/ HD Edition. The author Sri ‘M’ is an extraordinary individual. His uniqueness lies not only in the fact that at the young age of 19 and a half, he travelled to snow clad Himalayas from Kerala, and there he met and lived for several years with a ‘real-time’ yogi, Babaji, but also that he should undertake such an unusual and adventurous exploration, given his non-Hindu birth and antecedents. The metamorphosis of Mumtaz Ali Khan into Sri ‘M’, a yogi with profound knowledge of the Upanishads and deep personal insights, born of first hand experiences with higher levels of consciousness is indeed a fascinating story. The bonus for those interested in the secrets of yoga, meditation and sankhyan metaphysics is that Sri ‘M’ is still living and easily reachable. He leads a normal life, married with two children, wears no special robes and conducts himself without pomp or paraphernalia. Someone who met him recently said, “I expected a flashy godman and instead I saw a jean clad gentleman with a smile of his face, ready to discuss my problems. In five minutes flat, I said to myself, this is no ordinary man. The peace and tranquility that enters your system is tangible”.

He started his career at Manchester United as one of the famous 'Fergie Fledglings' and was also a star in Kevin Keegan's successful Newcastle United side that were dubbed 'The Entertainers'. Gillespie is also sixth on the list of highest appearance makers for his country, Northern Ireland. He has worked under many of the game's top managers - among them Sir Alex Ferguson, Kenny Dalglish, Graeme Souness, Neil Warnock and Lawrie McMenemy. Keith Gillespie hit the headlines in the 1990s for admitting to a serious gambling problem. In his autobiography, he talks powerfully and honestly about his addiction and the toll it took on him. Gillespie has also been hit hard by failed business deals and ill-advised investments. He hit the headlines again in 2010 after he was declared bankrupt. During his time at Leicester, Gillespie was among a group of footballers who were wrongly accused of rape while on a training break in La Manga.

1534,The War at Sixteen: Autobiography Volume II (1916-1919),"Julian Green was as young as the century when in 1916 his world was turned upside down by war. Encouraged by his father to 'do something' for the war effort he joined up in the American Field Service to fight for France, the land of his birth. After a period of training as an ambulance driver, he and his comrades were sent to the Argonne forest on the North-Eastern front where, shortly after his arrival, he heard the rumble of gun-fire reverberating from the forts of Verdun. It was not long before the horrors of war began to make their impression on his young mind: his first sight of a dead soldier made him a pacifist for life. Later, when it was discovered that he was actually too young to be at war, Green was sent home to Paris, but he soon managed to enlist in the American Red Cross and set off to serve as an ambulance driver once more, this time on the Italian front, north of Venice. A shy, serious and intensely devout boy who had lost his mother when he was only fourteen, his sudden and violent exposure to loneliness, suffering and death, and his first experiences of self discovery and sexual awakening were to mark his rise to maturity and permanently influence his development as a writer. Written many years later, by which time, Julian Green at the age of 64 was an acknowledged and distinguished writer, The War At Sixteen recreates those early years in a moving, revealing and ruthlessly honest account of adolescence.",0714529699,9780714529691,207,Julien Green,Euan Cameron, ,3.75,8,1,Marion Boyars Publishers,December 1st 1993,Hardcover,English,2376-340652.The_War_at_Sixteen.html
1535,Next Stop Execution: The Autobiography of Oleg Gordievsky,"Oleg Gordievsky was the highest ranking KGB officer ever to work for Britain. For eleven years, from 1974 to 1985, he acted as a secret agent, reporting to the British Secret Intelligence Service while continuing to work as a KGB officer, first in Copenhagen, then in London. He gave Western security organizations such a clear insight into the mind and methods of the KGB and the whole system of Soviet Government that he has been credited with doing more than any other individual in the West to accelerate the collapse of Communism. Here for the first time his extraordinary, meticulously planned escape from Russia is described. Peopled with bizarre, dangerous and corrupt characters, Gordievsky’s story introduces the reader to the fantastical world of the Soviet Embassy, tells of the British MPs and trade unionists who helped and took money from the KGB, and reveals at last what the author told Margaret Thatcher and other world leaders which made him of such value to the West. Gordievsky’s autobiography gives a fascinating account of life as a secret agent. It also paints the most graphic picture yet of the paranoia and incompetence, intrigues and sheer nastiness of the all-encompassing and sometimes ridiculous KGB. “Gripping.” – Luke Harding, Guardian correspondent and author of Mafia State: How one reporter became an enemy of the brutal new Russia “Only Gordievsky could...persuade the powers that mattered.” – The Spectator Oleg Gordievsky was born in Moscow in 1938.

1536,Uwe Rosler My Autobiography - Knocking Down Walls,"UWE ROSLER’S incredible passion and determination is never far from the surface; it’s what makes him a cult hero to a legion of Manchester City supporters. But it could have turned out much differently… Destined for an unremarkable career in East Germany, where the Berlin Wall presented a greater boundary than just bricks and mortar, Uwe was 25 and heading nowhere. Then, as the Iron Curtain dropped and a raw, uninhibited talent emerged, he was offered a chance at struggling English Premier League club, Manchester City. The mullet-haired striker was an instant hit. The fans loved his raw passion, commitment and the fact he wore his heart on his sleeve – that, plus he named his two sons, Colin and Tony, after club heroes Bell and Book. For three successive years he finished top scorer, and only severe cut-backs after a second relegation resulted in him moving on. But his biggest battle was yet to come.

1537,Telling the Stories of Life through Guided Autobiography Groups,"Telling the Stories of Life through Guided Autobiography Groups , based on James Birren's 25 years of conducting autobiography groups, discusses all the topics an organizer faces while developing a program for adults who want to recall and write down their life histories. This book is ideal for adult education programs, church groups, social workers, psychologists, gerontologists, and others who work with adults who might be interested in exploring, recording, or sharing their personal histories. It helps professionals and trained workshop leaders at community centers, senior centers, schools and other settings guide group participants in exploring major themes of their lives so that they can organize and write their stories and share them in a group with others on the same journey. This exercise is rewarding for adults of any age in a period of transition or with interest in gaining insight from their own stories. Personal development and a feeling of connection to other participants and their stories is a natural outcome of this process. This book provides background material and detailed lesson plans for those who wish to develop and lead an autobiography group. The authors explain the concept of guided autobiography, discuss the benefits to the group participants, and provide logistical information on how to plan, organize, and set up a group. An appendix provides exercises, handouts, and suggested adaptations for specific groups. The book also explains a systematic method of priming memories, including the history of family and of one's life work, the role of money, health and the body, and ideas about death. At a time when rapid change has created a widespread yearning to write down and exchange personal accounts, sharing life stories can reveal a great deal about how we have come to be the persons we are. Telling the Stories of Life through Guided Autobiography Groups shows how to organize, record, and share life experiences through a proven and effective technique.",0801866340,9780801866340,208,James E.

1538,Otto: the Autobiography of a Teddy Bear,"This is an autobiographical tale of a teddy bear named Otto. Otto is a German-born teddy bear. His first memories are of being stitched together and being given to David, a Jewish boy living in Germany before WWII. David and his best-friend Oskar always play with Otto, using him for pranks, games and even teaching him to type on a typewriter. Life is a lot of fun for the Otto. However, one day, David starts to wear a yellow star on his jacket. He and his parents are soon carted away by men in leather coats and uniforms. David decides to give his dear teddy bear to Oskar. Many lonely days pass for Oskar and Otto. But even gloomier days soon arrive when Osakar's father is drafted into the army and the bombings start. One day, a sudden explosion sends Otto flying through the air and into the middle a raging battle-field. The teddy bear is spotted by a soldier, but the moment the soldier picks Otto up, they are both shot through the chest. Otto and the soldier, an American G.I., are taken away to a hospital. In hospital, the soldier keeps Otto by his side. When he recovers, he pins a medal on Otto's chest, saying that Otto saved his life, taking the brunt of the bullet. The story makes papers and Otto becomes a mascot of the soldier's regiment. The teddy bear is then taken to America and is given to a sweet girl called Jasmin, the soldier's daughter. But Otto's new home and happiness is once again brutally ended when he is snatched away by mean and violent street urchins, who hit and trample on him and throw him into a bin. Otto is then picked up by an antiques dealer and taken to his shop. Years and years go by, until one rainy evening, when a bulky man stops and carefully examines the shop window. The man recognizes the bear instantly buys him. It is Oskar, Otto's old friend. The story of Oskar, a German tourist and survivor of the war finding his teddy bear in America soon makes the papers. And the day after Otto's picture appears in the paper, Oskar's telephone rings: it is his old friend David. And so, the three friends finally reunite, sharing the sorrows and pains of war and living a peaceful and happy life together. Otto now keeps himself busy, typing the story of his life on David's typewriter.

1539,Frame of Mind: The Autobiography of the World Snooker Champion,"When Graeme Dott won the World Snooker Championship in 2006 it should have been the highlight of his career. It was what he had worked for all his life, but Alex Lambie, his mentor and father-in-law, had cancer and only had months to live. Alex died at the end of 2006 and, incredibly, Dott's snooker went from strength to strength. Away from the table, his life was falling apart. He didn't know it, but he was suffering from severe depression. Just when he thought things couldn't get any worse, his wife Elaine suffered a cancer scare. She was pregnant at the time and although she was given the all-clear, she lost the baby. Dott was in a bad place and his snooker eventually suffered too and he plunged down the rankings.

In the events and musings recorded here we find the seeds of those themes that obsessed him throughout his career and imbued his classic novels The Immoralist and The Counterfeiters . Gide led a life of uncompromising self-scrutiny, and his literary works resembled moments of that life. With If It Die , Gide determined to relay without sentiment or embellishment the circumstances of his childhood and the birth of his philosophic wanderings, and in doing so to bring it all to light. Gide’s unapologetic account of his awakening homosexual desire and his portrait of Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas as they indulged in debauchery in North Africa are thrilling in their frankness and alone make If It Die an essential companion to the work of a twentieth-century literary master.",, ,310,André Gide,Dorothy Bussy, ,3.48,262,16,Vintage Books,,Paperback,English,2382-6332012-if-it-die-an-autobiography.html

1560,The Tunnel of Time: An Autobiography,"Snippets from the life of India’s best-loved cartoonist. R.K. Laxman has always had a rather unique way of looking at things. His Common Man cartoons have lampooned just about every aspect of political and social life over the past five decades. Now that he has, at long last, decided to write the story of his life, the narrative is imbued with the same acerbic wit and quizzical insights we are so familiar with, while the tone is that of a relaxed after-dinner conversation. There are anecdotes here that can rival the most uncanny adventures of the Common Man. Laxman is tormented by gamblers who are convinced they can see lucky numbers concealed in his cartoons, mistaken for a Mexican and debarred from attending an invitation dinner on Park Avenue because he is carrying a raincoat, and charged with importing obscene literature into the country because a friend has sent him a copy of Playboy. These descriptions are interspersed with delightful thumbnail sketches of luminaries ranging from Graham Greene to V.K. Krishna Menon. Always looking for the contradictions that make life unpredictable and reveling in absurd juxtapositions, Laxman embellishes his canvas with a keen sense of humour and the satirist’s ability to take a whimsical, cock-eyed look at just about anything under the sun. He is a gifted storyteller and pulls the reader along on an enchanting, comical journey down the corridors of time.",0140272488,9780140272482,237,R.K.

1563,Three Negro Classics (Up From Slavery; The Souls of Black Folk; The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man),"Up From Slavery is the autobiography of a great American, the fascinating story of Booker T. Washington. He was born the illegitimate son of a white man and a Negro slave, and his struggle for education became the struggle of all his people for dignity in an alien society. W.E.B. DuBois's The Souls of Black Folk is one of the undeniably great American books of our time, both a literary classic and a major sociological document. No other book has had greater influence on Negro thinking, and nowhere is the Negro's unique heritage and his kinship with all men so passionately described. James Weldon Johnson's Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man was published anonymously in 1912. It is a remarkable human document on the life of the American Negro, a profound interpretation of his feeling towards the white man and towards the members of his own race. It does not seem likely that any other book will be written that touches with such understanding and objectivity on the phenomenon once called ""passing"" in white society. These three classic and crucial documents in the evolution of the Negroes' consciousness of self - key documents, as well, in the development of white society's awareness of the NEgro situation - have never been more timely.

1564,China to Me: A Partial Autobiography,"Emily Hahn has written biography, fiction, short stories, and essays about China—all very successful. With this ""partial autobiography"" she gives the story behind these writings. For here at last is the complete and delightfully candid account of her life in China during the crucial years 1935-43. As a newspaperwoman, Miss Hahn was on the spot to witness the great events that changed the land of paddy fields and temple bells to battlefields of thunder and pain. But she was also an adopted member of a Chinese family and saw those things as an inhabitant, in terms of the people involved. She knew an impressive variety of these people: Chinese journalists, British diplomats, Japanese agents, American businessmen, intellectuals, crooks, dignitaries, and adventurers. They are spotlighted here, impaled by illustrative anecdote and discerning wit. You will also find out a lot about Miss Hahn herself, for she writes informally and with disarming intimacy. She tells of her escapades with officialdom; her seriocomic and legalistic marriage to the fascinating Sinmay; her love for Mr. Mills, a gibbon from Singapore; her brushes with the Jap secret police; and her determination to have a baby. She relates how she came to write her famous biography of the Soong sisters and finally how she was interned by the Japanese and exchanged on the Gripsholm .

1565,Life: An Autobiography as Told by Jack Gunthridge,"From their young days playing house to becoming heads of their own households while still in their teenage years, Jack and Christine's lives are linked, and Christine quickly becomes the love of his life. There is no doubt of his love for Christine, and he bluntly exposes his feelings for her to his readers, taking them by the hand into the heart and soul of the unrequited lover beginning at the age of six. Much more than simply a story of adolescence, Gunthridge writes in a voice reminiscent of J.D. Salinger. His accounts cross the generation line. If you have ever loved, you will be touched by this work. He crosses the act of love with the past, present and future bringing forth unexpected emotional involvement with his words, ideas and philosophies. He reminds readers why we love in the first place, why we consider the meaning of life, and later, why we examine the meaning of our own existence. For such powerfully touching words to come from such a young voice is extraordinary. This is not a simple memoir from a high school student, the mere fulfillment of an assignment, another reflection of teenage alienation and loss of innocence. This is a declaration of love for all time, not only for another, but in the end, for one's self. The ultimate love comes from the self and is expressed only when one is ready for more than passion. This work can easily be read alone or on a Saturday afternoon with the one you love. It can be shared between and across the generations. Gunthridge has given us one of those novels that you pass on to those you care for in your life. His work is an opportunity to experience now what will later be considered a classic. Read Gunthridge's Life and get a taste of profound writing in its youth and prime, poised to be as influential on the future of literature as the writer himself.

The detectives knew me, the lodging-house keepers knew me, and at last the poor creatures of the streets came to know me . . To me the frightened women looked for hope. In my presence they felt reassured and welcomed me to their dens and obeyed my commands eagerly . . "" Has a tortured impulse to confess lain long buried beneath these words? Amidst a vivid evocation of London life in the 1880's, Winslow unfolds the peculiar circumstances of his early years, the telling details of his family history, a shocking blow by blow depiction of each fatal encounter and his fond remembrance of the unfortunate victims of his unholy crusade. How did a 'perfectly normal upper-middle-class father andreasonably successful professional man' become the Whitechapel fiend? Why did the carnage begin? Why did it stop? What will your response be to the revelation of his all too human motives? Reality or fiction? This audacious work, though its concerns transcend any attempt to prove a particular identity, nonetheless paints such a compelling portrait that it may challenge the Ripperologists to reopen the case.",155395792X,9781553957928,322,Clanash Farjeon, , ,3.44,9,1,Trafford Publishing,March 1st 2003,Paperback,English,2405-62176.A_Handbook_for_Attendants_on_the_Insane.html

1571,Girl Singer: An Autobiography,"In Girl Singer , Rosemary Clooney, with the warmth and humor that distinguishes her singing, describes her transformation from a schoolgirl in kneesocks to one of the most beloved singers of the twentieth century. Rosemary Clooney made her first public appearance at the age of three, on the stage of the Russell Theater in her tiny hometown of Maysville, Kentucky. She has been singing ever since: on the local radio; with Tony Pastor's orchestra; in big-box-office Hollywood films; at the London Palladium, Carnegie Hall; on her own television series; and at venues large and small around the world. The list of her friends and intimates reads like a Who's Who of show business royalty: Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Marlene Dietrich, Tony Bennett, and Billie Holiday, to name just a few. At twenty-five, she married the erudite and respected actor José Ferrer, sixteen years her senior and light-years more sophisticated. Trouble started almost immediately when, on her honeymoon, she discovered that he had already been unfaithful. Finally, after having five children while she virtually single-handedly supported the entire family and his numerous, unrepentant infidelities, she filed for divorce. From there her life spiraled downward into depression, addiction to various prescription drugs, and then, in 1968, a breakdown and hospitalization. After years spent fighting her way back to the top--with two albums at the top of the Billboard charts in six years--Clooney is married to her long-lost love--a fairy tale with a happy ending.",0385493347,9780385493345,352,Rosemary Clooney,Joan Barthel, ,3.91,227,28,Doubleday,November 2nd 1999,Hardcover,English,241-1129822.Girl_Singer.html

These autobiographies challenge familial and cultural expectations and values that have traditionally forced queer Asian-Pacific Americans into silent shame because of their sexual orientation. Authors share not only their experiences growing up but also how those experiences led them to become social activists, speaking out against oppression. Many harmful untruths--or ""stories""--about queer Asian-Pacific Americans have been repeated so often, they are accepted as fact. Restoried Selves: Autobiographies of Queer Asian-Pacific-American Activists provides a forum for voices often ignored in academic literature to ""re-story"" themselves, addressing a range of experiences that includes cultural differences and values, conflicts between different generations in a family or between different groups in a community, and difficulties faced in coming out. Those giving voice to their stories through narrative and other writing genres include the transgendered and intersexed, community activists, youths, and parents. The stories told in Restoried Selves: Autobiographies of Queer Asian-Pacific-American Activists reflect on: * personal experiences—based on country of origin, educational background, religion, gender, and age * populations served by activism, including the working poor, immigrants, adoptees, youth, women, and families * different arenas of activism, including schools, governments, social services, and the Internet * issues targeted by activism, including affirmative action, HIV/AIDS education, mental health, interracial relationships, and sexual violence * institutions in need of change, including legal, religious, and educational entities * and much more!",1560234636,9781560234630,0,Kevin K.

When the validity of this coup is challenged, this emboldened mother goes to battle with both inner and outer forces threatening her fragile self-esteem. Ultimately it is the belief system held by both blacks and whites that is on the front lines as issues of race, color, beauty and the origins of it all culminate in this psychological journey through the life of a black woman determined to give her daughter what she herself must recoup, a healthy self-esteem. The coronation of the first black ""Miss America"" in 1983 serves as a backdrop for understanding ourselves and the complexities of American society brought sharply into focus by the guest appearance of that enduring, indefatigable icon, ""Barbie.""

1597,Hindsight: An Autobiography,"Hindsight is the memoir of an outsider: a stateless person; a Jew; and, as Wolff called herself, a “conscious” lesbian. Love for women had been her inclination since she could remember and she writes that no one in her family questioned it. In Hindsight, she describes her girlfriends from Danzig of 1910 with the same candor as adult lovers she meets in Germany, France and England. She gives a vivid account of the years she spent as a physician and party girl in Weimar Berlin, her friendship with Walter and Dora Benjamin, and her interest in chirology (the study of hands) and sexology. Wolff writes movingly about Jewish identity and history, medicine, psychotherapy, and her life as a 20th century lesbian. She is particularly insightful about how statelessness affects the psyche. She probes her attraction to glamorous friends such as the fashion journalist Helen Hessel (Kathe of Jules and Jim) and Baladine Klossowska (mother of the painter Balthus) in Paris. She describes the wartime refugee colony of Sanary, France and the Quakers, Surrealists, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, and Maria and Aldous Huxley whom she met there. When she moves to London in 1936, her medical degree is not recognized and she reads hands for a living, including the hands of Virginia Woolf, Sybille Bedford, and the Duchess of Windsor, before becoming a researcher at University College London. Though reluctant to become what she called a “professional lesbian,” Wolff began to join same-sex political groups in the 1960s, after researching her book Love Between Women, published in 1971.",0704322536,9780704322530,312,Charlotte Wolff, , ,0.00,0,0,Quartet Books (UK),October 1st 1981,Hardcover,English,2433-3343653-hindsight.html

1604,The Fry Chronicles : An Autobiography (Memoir #2),"""Jotta piittaisin ruumiistani, minulla pitäisi olla piittaamisen arvoinen ruumis. Jo pienestä pitäen minä tunsin pelkkää häpeää hyödyttömästä maallisesta majastani. Se ei osannut syöttää, lyödä eikä ottaa kiinni krikettipalloa. Se ei osannut tanssia. Se ei osannut hiihtää, sukeltaa eikä hypätä. Kun astuin baariin tai klubiin, ruumiini ei vetänyt puoleensa ahnaan himokkaita katseita eikä edes lievästi kiinnostuneita vilkaisuja. Siinä ei ollut mitään muuta hyvää kuin toiminta aivojeni polttoainekennona ja sellaisten myrkkyjen kaatopaikkana, jotka saattoivat tuoda minulle nautinnon huumaa ja syitä hilpeyteen. Ehkä koko jutussa on oikeastaan kysymys rinnoista. Tai niiden puutteesta."" Kun Stephen Fry aloitti opiskelut Cambridgessa, hän oli aikamoinen lurjus. Hänet oli tuomittu petoksesta ehdonalaiseen vankeuteen, hän oli varastellut ja valehdellut läpi kouluaikansa. Jatkuva kiinni jäämisen pelko kalvoi häntä, eikä hän uskonut koskaan sopeutuvansa.Opiskeluajasta tuli kuitenkin hänen elämänsä käännekohta.

1607,Autobiography of a Homegirl,"Autobiography of A Homegirl is the bittersweet story of a black woman's epiphany when, in a 24 hour stretch, her child's father shows up with his white fiancee and, in an historic coup, the first black woman is crowned, ""Miss America."" When the validity of this coup is challenged, this emboldened mother goes to battle with both inner and outer forces threatening her fragile self-esteem. Ultimately it is the belief system held by both blacks and whites that is on the front lines as issues of race, color, beauty and the origins of it all culminate in this psychological journey through the life of a black woman determined to give her daughter what she herself must recoup, a healthy self-esteem. The coronation of the first black ""Miss America"" in 1983 serves as a backdrop for understanding ourselves and the complexities of American society brought sharply into focus by the guest appearance of that enduring, indefatigable icon, ""Barbie."" The play explores how entrenched standards of beauty have affected not just African American women, but all women.

1610,The Pleader: An Autobiography,"Len Murray, described by a High Court judge as the most respected pleader of his generation, practised as a solicitor in Glasgow for over 40 years. As part of a triumvirate of top lawyers based in the city during its period of renaissance, he built up one of the most respected law practices in the country. Among the benchmark cases with which Murray was involved was that of Tony Miller, one of the last people to be hanged in Scotland. Despite a desperate appeal by Murray, the 19-year-old was sent to his death on 22 December 1960. In his candid account Murray describes both the legal arguments and the personal effect the case had on him. Murray was also involved in bringing the Nazi war criminal Antanas Gecas to justice after his discovery in Edinburgh, he was the only solicitor ever to be retained by both Rangers and Celtic footballers who were accused of assaulting each other during a match at Ibrox, and he made a cheeky defence of famous Beatle Paul McCartney who was arrested on drugs charges. The Pleader recounts these and many more tales of the courts and the characters who inhabited them, whether they sat on the bench or stood in the dock. Reluctant to go public until now, Murray has always upheld the simple tenet that client confidentiality is paramount. His decision to publish his memoirs at this time reflects a feeling that he has a responsibility to new students of law and to old friends to put the record straight on many of the fascinating stories to come before the Scottish courts. From the simplest of violations to the most serious of capital crimes, he opens his amazing and hitherto secret files to the world.",1780577702,9781780577708,0,Len Murray, , ,4.50,2,0,Mainstream Digital,December 7th 2012,ebook, ,2445-17615356-the-pleader.html

I've been living amongst you for hundreds of years. None of you know that we actually exist, but there are a few of us roaming around, co-existing. There are ways to hide without hiding. We may be different in some ways, but in many we are the same. The earth holds many different animals, but we all seek the same things overall. Human beings find it difficult to accept things that aren't understood, but there are many unexplained wonders of the world. Stories written about us are close to the truth, but also far from the truth. This is the story of my life already lived, with many chapters still to come in my alleged immortal existence. My father told me of his story, which I have incorporated with mine to give you the full picture.

Written from Moscow in 1967, My Silent War shook the world and introduced a new archetype in fiction: the unrepentant spy. It inspired John le Carré’s Smiley novels and the later espionage novels of Graham Greene. Kim Philby was history’s most successful spy. He was also an exceptional writer who gave us the great iconic story of the Cold War and revolutionized, in the process, the art of espionage writing.",0375759832,9780375759833,256,Kim Philby, , ,3.47,283,39,Modern Library,September 24th 2002,Paperback,English,245-845996.My_Silent_War.html

Throughout his time at Ibrox, his aggressive approach won him hero status among the Rangers fans, and off the field he was just as dynamic a force, finding himself on the front pages of the national newspapers as often as in the sports sections.

In a career that saw him win twelve caps for Holland and an array of silverware and titles for Fortuna Sittard, AZ Alkmaar, Rangers and Zenit St Petersburg, Ricksen has stood out both on and off the field with the sheer force of his personality and his never-say-die attitude.

1639,Darren Lehmann Worth The Wait An Autobiography,"One of Australian cricket's biggest names and most entertaining characters, Darren Lehmann talks candidly about his life - friends, enemies, team mates, tragedies, regrets and the incredible highs and lows of an astounding career in cricket - in this refreshingly honest and engaging autobiography. Lehmann draws the reader back to those first games of street cricket with local kids in Gawler, South Australia, to turning down an early offer to join the Australian Cricket Academy (much to the horror of some), and relives the thrill of being picked to play for Australia for the first time, only to have his hopes dashed and be named 12th man at the last minute. In one of Australian cricket's most fascinating stories, eight years would pass before Lehmann would be picked to play for his country again. And long years they were; this was the limbo period that fuelled the long-standing belief that Lehmann irked officialdom by choosing his own path instead of the one they laid out for him. Two World Cup triumphs, a notorious outburst that saw him banned amid a media frenzy, missing the opening matches of the 2003 World Cup, the tragic death of his close friend David Hookes, and countless centuries and now long-overdue recognition as one of the most powerful batsmen in this current Australian side make Darren Lehmann's story an absolutely fascinating one. He has it all: Experience. Talent. Fire. Knowledge. Trust. And plenty of dues.",1740663306,9781740663304,0,Darren Lehmann, , ,2.80,5,0,Hardie Grant Books,2005,Paperback,English,2471-6685261-darren-lehmann-worth-the-wait-an-autobiography.html

1641,White Tiger: An Autobiography of Yang Xianyi,"It all began with a dream. A young woman saw a white tiger leap into her lap. It was both auspicious and unlucky -- her son, the fortune-teller said, would grow up with no brothers, and his father's health would be endangered by his birth. That son, however, would have a distinguished career, after going through many misfortunes and dangers.The dream was prophetic. The child was his mother's only male child and his father died of illness when the boy was only five. He grew up during the wartime and period of political turmoil in China, passing through many troubles, and he has had a very distinguished career. He is Yang Xianyi, renowned scholar, translator and interpreter of Chinese and Western literature. This delightful memoir of Yang Xianyi gives a candid and entertaining account of himself as a lighthearted and mischievous young man who immersed himself in the learning of European culture, ancient and modern, when he studied at Oxford in the 1930s. But it is also the illuminating self-portrait of a deeply patriotic intellectual living in a China under the throes of change, giving rare insight into the survival of a courageous, witty and principled individual during the harsh century of Chinese liberation.",962996046X,9789629960469,302,Yang Xianyi,Xianyi Yang, ,4.00,1,0,Chinese University Press,April 9th 2003,Paperback,English,2473-1014868.White_Tiger.html
1642,Framing Identities: Autobiography and the Politics of Pedagogy,"How do historically marginalized groups expose the partiality and presumptions of educational institutions through autobiographical acts? How are the stories we tell used to justify resistance to change or institutional complacency? These are the questions Wendy S. Hesford asks as she considers the uses of autobiography in educational settings. This book demonstrates how autobiographical acts -- oral, written, performative, and visual -- play out in vexed and contradictory ways and how in the academy they can become sites of cultural struggle over multicultural education, sexual harassment, institutional racism, hate speech, student activism, and commemorative practices. Within the context of Oberlin, a small liberal arts college in Ohio, this book looks at the uses of autobiographical practices in empowering groups traditionally marginalized in academic settings. Investigating the process of self-representation and the social, spatial, and discursive frames within which academic bodies and identities are constituted, Framing Identities explores the use of autobiographical acts in terms of power, influence, risks involved, and effectiveness. Hesford provides a model for teacher-researchers across the disciplines (education, English, composition, cultural studies, women's studies, to name a few) to investigate the contradictory uses and consequences of autobiography, and to carve out new pedagogical spaces.",0816631549,9780816631544,248,Wendy S.

1643,Jeanette MacDonald Autobiography: The Lost Manuscript,"""Perhaps the most unbelievable note I ever received backstage was between the second and third act of [the opera] Romeo and Juliet. It read: 'Please sing ""The Indian Love Call"" during the next intermission.'"" So writes Jeanette MacDonald in her unpublished autobiography. This book tells the fascinating story of that ill-fated project and includes an incomplete, unpolished edition dating from summer 1960. Written in collaboration with movie magazine writer Fredda Dudley Balling, the typewritten manuscript has Jeanette's hand-written comments and corrections all over it. She crossed out certain sensitive passages and entire pages but the full manuscript is reproduced so that today's reader can experience it uncensored. How much did the beloved MGM singing star reveal? Did she tell the truth about her life? Her career? Her purported first marriage to Bob Ritchie? Her Hollywood marriage to Gene Raymond? Her romance with co-star Nelson Eddy? What did Balling think of their collaboration...and the final book? Why did Jeanette need a ghost writer and why was this mysterious book never published? MacDonald biographer Sharon Rich answers these questions. She has fully annotated the manuscript, providing reality checks, extensive background data and tragic new information about Jeanette's final years. Also included is Fredda Balling's correspondence about the project and working with MacDonald. The book includes a filmography, photos and a rare color picture gallery.",0971199884,9780971199880,455,Sharon Rich, , ,3.50,4,0,Bell Harbour Press,July 23rd 2004,Paperback, ,2475-3090503-jeanette-macdonald-autobiography.html

1648,El Sicario: The Autobiography of a Mexican Assassin,"In this unprecedented and chilling monologue, a repentant Mexican hitman tells the unvarnished truth about the war on drugs on the American. El Sicario is the hidden face of America's war on drugs. He is a contract killer who functioned as a commandante in the Chihuahuan State police, who was trained in the US by the FBI, and who for twenty years kidnapped, tortured and murdered people for the drug industry at the behest of Mexican drug cartels. He is a hit man who came off the killing fields alive. He left the business and turned to Christ. And then he decided to tell the story of his life and work. Charles Bowden first encountered El Sicario while reporting for the book ""Murder City"". As trust between the two men developed, Bowden bore witness to the Sicario's unfolding confession, and decided to tell his story. The well-spoken man that emerges from the pages of El Sicario is one who has been groomed by poverty and driven by a refusal to be one more statistic in the failure of Mexico. He is not boastful, he claims no major standing in organized crime. But he can explain in detail not only torture and murder, but how power is distributed and used in the arrangement between the public Mexican state and law enforcement on the ground - where terror and slaughter are simply tools in implementing policy for both the police and the cartels. And he is not an outlaw or a rebel. He is the state. When he headed the state police anti-kidnapping squad in Juarez, he was also running a kidnapping ring in Juarez. When he was killing people for money in Juarez, he was sharpening his marksmanship at the Federal Police range. Now he lives in the United States as a fugitive. One cartel has a quarter million dollar contract on his head. Another cartel is trying to recruit him. He speaks as a free man and of his own free will - there are no charges against him. He is a lonely voice - no one with his background has ever come forward and talked. He is the future - there are thousands of men like him in Mexico and there will be more in other places. He is the truth no one wants to hear.",1568586582,9781568586588,345,Molly Molloy,Molly Molloy, ,3.63,321,43,Nation Books,May 10th 2011,Paperback,English,248-11149911-el-sicario.html

As popular as he was cantankerous, he brushed shoulders with presidents and corporate barons, tsars and dictators.

1651,Autobiography of an Archive: A Scholar's Passage to India,"The decades between 1970 and the end of the twentieth century saw the disciplines of history and anthropology draw closer together, with historians paying more attention to social and cultural factors and the significance of everyday experience in the study of the past. The people, rather than elite actors, became the focus of their inquiry, and anthropological insights into agriculture, kinship, ritual, and folk customs enabled historians to develop richer and more representative narratives. The intersection of these two disciplines also helped scholars reframe the legacies of empire and the roots of colonial knowledge. In this collection of essays and lectures, history's turn from high politics and formal intellectual history toward ordinary lives and cultural rhythms is vividly reflected in a scholar's intellectual journey to India. Nicholas B. Dirks recounts his early study of kingship in India, the rise of the caste system, the emergence of English imperial interest in controlling markets and India's political regimes, and the development of a crisis in sovereignty that led to an extraordinary nationalist struggle. He shares his personal encounters with archives that provided the sources and boundaries for research on these subjects, ultimately revealing the limits of colonial knowledge and single disciplinary perspectives. Drawing parallels to the way American universities balance the liberal arts and specialized research today, Dirks, who has occupied senior administrative positions and now leads the University of California at Berkeley, encourages scholars to continue to apply multiple approaches to their research and build a more global and ethical archive.",0231169671,9780231169677,400,Nicholas B.

1652,Carry Me Home: My Autobiography,"Ben Cohen’s dad didn’t know anything about the sport his young son had taken up, but he was happy to drive him to practice, and was soon helping out at the club. When his business went bankrupt money was tight, but Ben’s hard working parents inspired their son to put his all into rugby. Then, when Ben was 20, his father intervened in a fight in the nightclub where he worked. He was viciously beaten and one month later he died in hospital. Ben was doing an England press conference at the time, and it was down to coach Clive Woodward to deliver the devastating news. But the ordeal was far from over. The inquest lasted five months before the funeral could be held, and it was a year before the family were in court, facing Peter’s assailants. Ben put all of the anger and pain from his father’s death into his rugby. Fast and powerful on the wing, he was soon the best in the world in his position and a cornerstone of the England team, culminating in the legendary World Cup win in Sydney in 2003. And yet he always felt like an outsider. Most people didn’t know that Ben is clinically deaf. His sixth sense for the game got him through on the pitch, but off it his poor hearing was often taken for arrogance.

Although written with gushing, romantic enthusiasm, her kaleidoscopic story of a long-lost innocence just before and after World War I helps to explain Kaye's idealization of the British Raj and her love for Kipling's verse.

The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin is the traditional name for the unfinished record of his own life written by Benjamin Franklin from 1771 to 1790; however, Franklin himself appears to have called the work his Memoirs. Although it had a tortuous publication history after Franklin's death, this work has become one of the most famous and influential examples of an autobiography ever written. Franklin's account of his life is divided into four parts, reflecting the different periods at which he wrote them. In these parts, several aphorisms are made about friendship. These are somewhat confusing, but can be understood with some comprehension skills. There are actual breaks in the narrative between the first three parts, but Part Three's narrative continues into Part Four without an authorial break (only an editorial one).",, ,102,This Ebook Features Amazing Dynamic Chapter Link Navigation for a Premium Reading Experience Plus Th,Benjamin Franklin, ,3.25,8,0,Northpointe Classics,February 1st 2012,Kindle Edition,English,2494-20429200-the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin-illustrated-annotated-unabri.html

This updated and candid biography covers more than four decades’ worth of life at the cutting edge of the music business, as well as providing a new and very personal insight into Midge as a family man, his battles with alcoholism and his ability to survive in a notoriously fickle industry. Few musicians have had a career of such variety: he has sold more than twenty million albums and been on a rollercoaster ride through the rock and roll business. From Number 1 hits with the pop band Slik, via Ultravox – one of the most influential bands to come out of the age of electronica and leaders of the New Romantic movement – to sell-out solo world tours, Midge has a unique perspective on the world of pop music. he played a key role in the phenomenon that was Live Aid and the making of the classic charity record Do They Know It's Christmas, which sold in excess of twelve million copies. This updated book covers the reforming of the classic eighties Ultravox line-up and the subsequent Brilliant album generated from the reunion, as well as the ongoing battles with the record labels, and even Midge’s involvement with 'reality' TV. As Midge says, 'sometimes my life feels like running up an ever quickening down escalator, but its an escalator of my own design and choosing. The trick is to sustain momentum, try and edge forward and not let it drag you to the bottom.' If I Was… is a true testament to the talent and energy of a man who remains as vibrant today as when he first set out to become a musician forty years ago.

Then he embarked on a second career as a Special Assistant to the Commissioner of Baseball. Monte Irvin was a baseball pioneer. He was the Negro League owners' choice to be the first black player to enter the major leagues and break the color line, but his army service held him back. Still, Irvin became one of the first African Americans to play major league baseball when he was signed with the Giants in 1949. Later, after seven years as the Giant's centerfielder and clutch hitter, Irvin was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1973. Readers will learn about the good times and hard times of life in the Negro Leagues, and New York Giants fans will be enthralled as Monte recounts his experiences with Leo Durocher's teams, including the dramatic 1951 comeback that triumphed with the most memorable single play in baseball history - Bobby Thompson's ""Shot Heard around the World."" He also relates his conversation with Willie Mays as the two trotted off the field after what is still referred to as ""The Catch"" in the 1954 World Series.",0786702540,9780786702541,252,Monte Irvin,James A.

And what special role do narratives play in identifying one as a person in the world? This book explores these questions from the vantage points of various human and cultural sciences, with special attention to the importance of narrative as expression of embodied experience, mode of communication, and form for understanding the world and ultimately ourselves. Presenting a variety of perspectives from narrative psychology and literary criticism, to discourse, communication and cultural theory these studies examine the intricacies of narrative identity construction. With contributions from some of the leading scholars in the field, the book highlights the cultural field in which narratives shape forms of life.

1679,Darwin Compendium: Voyage of the Beagle/Origin of the Species/Descent of Man & Selection in Relation to Sex/Expression of Emotions in Humans & Animals/Autobiography,"The father of modern evolutionary thought, Charles Darwin showed the world a new way to explain the origins of living things. The Darwin Compendium helps to generate an understanding of what Darwin's potent ideas were, and how they affect the very nature of our civilization and understanding of the universe. This collection includes five of his core works: In The Voyage of the Beagle (1839), a young Darwin travels to the Galapagos Islands, where the diversity of finches and iguanas leads him to hypothesize that living organisms changed over time. The Origin of Species (1859), Darwin's most celebrated work, states that natural selection-the theory of survival of the fittest-resulted in the wide variety of life on earth. The Descent of Man (1871) argues that there is considerable evidence that humans are part of the animal kingdom and have been created according to the same natural laws that produced all other life on earth. To further his thesis of humans as part of the natural world, Darwin published The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). In this work he argued that facial expressions in humans are complex forms of communication performed by intricate musculature that was the result of evolutionary processes. In 1876, after years of insults and praise over his theories about the world, Charles Darwin took stock of his own life and wrote Autobiography of Charles Darwin.",0760778140,9780760778142,1920,Charles Darwin,Brian Regal, ,4.29,14,2,Barnes & Noble,October 31st 2005,cloth,English,2508-84963.Darwin_Compendium.html

1683,Milton Berle: An Autobiography,"When Milton Berle died in the Spring of 2002, THE NEW YORK TIMES declared that the legendary comic ""may have had a more profound influence on our way of life than some presidents or Nobel Prize winners."" This landmark memoir, as startling today as it was when it was first published, reveals the life and times of the man known affectionately to millions as Uncle Miltie. Told with unflinching candor, here is one of the most fabled and influential show business careers of all time: from performing as a child in Vaudeville and making silent movies with Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford, to nightclub performances for Al Capone, working on radio during World War II, performing in Broadway musicals, and, finally, superstardom on television. Perhaps even more fascinating is Berle's scandal-ridden private life: his star-crossed love affair with a 1930's movie queen and the child they had out of wedlock, his numerous affairs with women ranging from evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson to Marilyn Monroe, and his stormy relationship with beautiful showgirl Joyce Mathews, whom Berle married twice. It is Berle's unsparing account of his life and his determination to show the world his real face that led Frank Sinatra, at the time, to call this ""the gutsiest book I've read in years."" Told with equal amounts of comedy and pathos, and featuring colorful appearancesby all the major stars of his day, MILTON BERLE is simply one of the best show business memoirs ever written.",, ,338,Milton Berle,Haskel with Frankel, ,5.00,1,0,Applause Books,September 1st 2002,Kindle Edition,English,2511-20742263-milton-berle.html

1689,The Doctor's House: An Autobiography,"This is an unconventional autobiography of one of Ireland's most engaging and independent poets. In the first section, James Liddy describes his early life in Co. Wexford. His father was a Dispensary doctor, and his mother was an American from New York. Liddy's poetic prose style conveys a sense of living in both past and present. His love of the unusual, and a striving for intellectual freedom, propelled him, as a student in Dublin, to become one of the literary mandarins who made McDaid's pub the centre of Irish literary life. Patrick and Katherine Kavanagh, John Jordan, Richard Riordain, and Michael Hartnett figured largely in his life at that time, as did American writers Edward Dahlberg and Anthony Kerrigan. James Liddy was a member of a new generation of writers in the 1960s; this book gives the flavour of this sparkling period. The final chapters, his pivotal move to America, his adventures in San Francisco, New Orleans, and the German-American dream city of Milwaukee, mark the development of his poetry and his ever present sense of fun and intellectual exploration.",190339239X,9781903392393,144,James Liddy, , ,4.00,2,0,Salmon Publishing,March 1st 2005,Paperback,English,2517-576473.The_Doctor_s_House.html
1690,Boy from Bethulie: An Autobiography,"""Boy from Bethulie"" is a major theatrical autobiography, which is both funny and breathtakingly honest. Part history of mainstream South African theatre from the 1950s and part social documentary of the communities Mynhardt has played to--sophisticated audiences in ostentatious national theatres; rural audiences in tiny, ill-equipped and draughty halls in desolate platteland towns and villages; business executives in bomas in the bush--the book focuses a spotlight on the people and places intricately linked with the actor's life. Mynhardt is searingly honest, but the honesty is tempered with a self-deprecating humor that more often than not makes him the butt of his own jokes. In the words of the author, """"My Boy from Bethulie began to take shape in theatre dressing rooms, in hotels, in pubs, and parties a These occasions were the scene of my impromptu raconteur performances, unplanned and quite unrehearsed, given the spontaneity of immediate recollection."""" Mynhardt's storytelling skills that turned his childhood memories into the extraordinarily successful show Boy from Bethuli, translate easily onto the page and cover all aspects of his life. But most of all, the book reveals the many parts of the man who has come to be known as South Africa's Laurence Olivier. ""Boy from Bethulie's first half is a rich evocation of a period and of a wry, humane sensibility u Myrnhardt includes others in his pleasure of recollection."" --Robert Greig, ""Business Day"" ""Wherever Patrick went and whatever he said or did, Bethulie followed him with interest and admiration."" --Rums van Rensburg, Mayor of Bethulie",186814397X,9781868143979,448,Patrick Mynhardt, , ,3.67,3,1,Witwatersrand University Press Publications,August 1st 2004,Paperback,English,2518-3774383-boy-from-bethulie.html

1712,An Open Book - My Autobiography,"A golfer loved for his courage and charisma, Darren Clarke has the crowds behind him. They know he is a warm, funny raconteur who likes a Guinness, who both works hard and plays hard. More important, they know that this man pulled himself up by his bootstraps, having lost his wife Heather to cancer, to triumph at the 2006 Ryder Cup. Just days before the start of the 2011 Open at Royal St George's, Darren's game had once again deserted him, leaving him 'putting like a man with blurred vision'. A month before his 43rd birthday he was not in a good place. But Heather was 'watching from above', the crowd were roaring him on, golf guru Dr Bob Rotella was telling him to 'go unconscious' - and something sparked inside him. The rest is golfing history. Born in Dungannon, Northern Ireland, Darren caddied for his golf course greenkeeper father, turning pro in 1990. He has played in four victorious Ryder Cup sides and beat his close friend Tiger Woods in the 36-hole final of the 2000 WGC-Andersen Consulting Match Play. In 2002 he became the only player to win the English Open three times. In An Open Book he speaks candidly about fellow-players, coaches and golfing psychologists; about how he was bullied at school, narrowly missed and IRA bomb and eventually set up a foundation to develop junior golf in Ireland; and about how he found personal happiness again, marrying Alison Campbell in April 2012.

1725,No Destination: An Autobiography,"Written with a penetrating simplicity, No Destination is an exhilarating account of an extraordinary life. When he was only nine years old, Satish Kumar renounced the world and joined the wandering brotherhood of Jain monks. Dissuaded from this path by an inner voice at the age of 18, he became a campaigner for land reform, working to turn Gandhi's vision of a renewed India into reality. Fired by the example of Bertrand Russell, he undertook an 8,000-mile peace pilgrimage, walking from India to America without any money, through mountains, deserts, storms, and snow. It was an adventure during which he was thrown into jail in France, faced a loaded gun in America, and delivered packets of “peace tea” to the leaders of the four nuclear powers. In 1973 he settled in England, taking on the editorship of Resurgence magazine, and becoming the guiding light behind a number of ecological spiritual and educational ventures. Following Indian tradition, in his 50th year he undertook another pilgrimage: again without any money, he walked to the holy places of Britain—Glastonbury Lindisfarne and Iona.

He quickly rose to the presidency and, in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr., whose career he'd followed and whose death he learned of at Pennhurst, was soon traveling across the US and to Canada and England to speak to other fledgling self-advocacy groups and at conferences of professionals, and to work toward establishing a US national self-advocacy organization. Originally published after Johnson's death by Speaking For Ourselves, the group Johnson headed up for much of the 1990s, the book sold out its first small printing.

And that's just the warm-up! From the author's Prologue: ""My life can be perceived as a series of three major storms. As a young adult, I rode out the squalls of my coming of age as a college student in the 1960s. [Chapter 3 has been adopted as part of the online history pproject at Vassar College] ""... While trapped in the jaws of a demonic hurricane, [the Category 5 Hurricane Hugo on the island of St. Thomas in 1989] I clung to the arms of a sofa and prayed repeatedly, 'God spare life! ...' ""...

1751,Autobiography of Doyle Brunson,"The story of Doyle Brunson, the greatest poker player of all time, is one for the ages, a story of guts and glory, of good luck and bad, of triumph and unspeakable tragedy, of courage and grace under fire. It is a story of beating the odds, of a man who bet one million dollars on a hole of golf-that when he could barely stand!-who is known as the biggest sports bettor in the world, and who has bet enormous sums of money on just about ""anything. He's been hard-up flat broke more times than can be counted and he has sat on top of millions. A master of the bluff, here is a man whose most outrageous bluff came with a gunman pointing a pistol at his forehead. Brunson has seen it all: Athletic dreams and a leg shattered by a freak injury which waylaid his path to the NBA (he was drafted by the Lakers) and opened the doors for the most remarkable gambling career ever, of dodging bullets, bandits, lawmen, murderers and cutthroats while plying his poker trade in the back rooms and back roads of Texas with the legendary Amarillo Slim and Sailor Roberts. He has survived whippings, gun fights, stabbings, mobsters, killers-of a group of 32 men he played poker with in the tough alleys of Texas, just he and one other survived all these years-and a bout with cancer where the doctor told him his hand was played out, he was drawing dead, he was a goner. Apparently, fate had never played poker with Brunson; he lived.Twice a winner of the prestigious World Series of Poker in Las Vegas, he's won millions and lost millions-sometimes in seconds-but decidedly more of the former than the latter. Every day, still, Brunson can be found playing in the highest stakes poker games in the world, often with as muchas one million dollars in front of him. At the Poker Hall of Fame, they call him Texas Dolly, but his real name is Doyle Brunson. To every one of the 75 million people play poker each year, Doyle Brunson, author of the best-selling ""bible"" of poker, ""Doyle Brunson's Super System, is THE legend, THE king, THE MAN-the Babe Ruth of Poker-the greatest gambler and poker player who has ever lived.

1759,Letter to the Past: An Autobiography,"George Woodcock, author of almost 50 books, now turns to his own story in Letter to the Past: An Autobiography. Although he was born in Winnipeg in 1912, Woodcock grew up in England. His memories of adolescence and young manhood take the reader through two World Wars and a Depression, before his return to Canada in 1949. Those whom he knew and who influenced him emerge in penetrating detail from Woodcock’s narrative: his father, dying of Bright’s Disease, yet with his spirit of adventure unquenched; his friend, George Orwell, “butter-fingeredly rolling cigarettes of the strongest black shag he could find and drinking tea as dark and almost as thick as treacle”; and the teeming London political and literary figures of the ‘30s and ‘4Os he knew as editor of the spritely literary journal, NOW, and as a young anarchist and writer. George Woodcock, winner of the Governor General’s Award and the Molson Prize, now lives in Vancouver, where he founded and edited for many years Canadian Literature. He has written countless articles and books, including critical studies of novelists Hugh MacLennan and Mordecai Richler and artist Ivan Eyre, as well as biographies of George Orwell, Thomas Merton, Oscar Wilde and Kropotkin, and the panoramic study of Canada entitled The Canadians. Here is what the critics have said of Letter to the Past: “It is not so much that chronicling the lives of William Godwin, Kropotkin, and Proudhon has constituted for Woodcock a profession like that of a portraitist; more that the underlying emotional attributes of anarchism a profound distrust of all authority mixed with a liberal dash of utopianism — have been the informing principles in his life.” — Saturday Night “The graceful prose is so rich in detail that its effect is almost that of a life invented, not remembered.” — Maclean’s",155005192X,9781550051926,331,George Woodcock, , ,4.00,1,0,Fitzhenry & Whiteside,November 18th 2010,Paperback,English,2580-12995485-letter-to-the-past.html

1762,"An Autobiography, Vols 1-2","The book has active table of contents for readers to access each chapter of the book. Hebert Spencer coined the famous expression “survival of the fittest”. Spencer’s theory inspired Andrew Carnegie and William Graham Sumner's visions of unbridled and unrepentant capitalism of the United States in late nineteenth-century. Carnegie interpreted Spencer's social theory as justifying merciless economic competition. Spencer's reputation was not recovered for many years from the interpretative caricatures of many scholars, thus marginalizing him to the hinterlands of intellectual history. Fortunately, recent scholarship has begun restoring and repairing his legacy and theory. This is a must book for readers who are interested in studying and correctly interpreting Spencer’s theory that can be simply coined by him as “survival of the fittest”.",, ,0,Herbert Spencer, , ,3.00,1,0, , ,Kindle Edition,English,2583-20707534-an-autobiography-vols-1-2.html

1765,"Gulliver's Travels, Autobiography","My niece, Deni, who for some odd reason thinks I’m OK and have had an interesting life, has asked me to write my autobiography. Now, I have thought my life interesting, but not that anyone else would consider it so. But I’m going to write this if only for her benefit. Life has always been to me a Great Adventure. With all its ups and downs, heartaches, etc., it is still a Great Adventure. But my overriding concern and question all my life has been, “What in Hell is it all about?” In other words, “What is the meaning of life?” It wasn’t until my fortieth year that I found the answer and from there on everything was up, whereas before, it had all been down, 'til I hit absolute bottom. At that time, I had an experience of God that made me a newborn Christian. It was the biggest event in my life, and it replaced my misery with true happiness. My life heretofore had been, for the first thirty-nine years, a search for Truth, and thereafter a spiritual journey. Because I think that the vast majority of people can identify with my problems and the answers I found, I think the book may be well worth writing. For life is essentially a spiritual journey and the sooner we realize it, the sooner we can get on the right track. If I had known about God at twenty what I know now my life would have been a much better and happier one. I have called life a great adventure-- it is really an adventure in the nature of a treasure hunt or a hunt for the Pearly of Great Price. Try Happiness. We humans might logically assume that the Truth about life would be made clear in due course by our parents and teachers as we grow up. But in this only quasi-Christian society, such is simply not the case. I am convinced that the vast majority of people have to stumble on it themselves, as I did. It is a great tragedy for the Truth is readily available in Christian teaching. About the title, there is a story in Dad’s family that connects us with the hero of Gulliver’s Travels. It is pretty well established that our ancestor was a boat builder on the Thames above London. The story goes that he was a retired sea captain who got spinning tall yearns, probably with a pipe in one hand and a jug in the other. His reputation spread and Jonathan Swift heard about him and went up the Thames to visit him, and then wrote his book based on these tall tales. I don’t know how true it is, but it makes a good story. The work “Homecoming” is the title I chose in contrast to the work “Travels” in the original book, implying that I finally made homeport. For as I have heard someone say, “Our home is in Heaven, we’re here on a visit, and having a Hell of a time getting back.” We are strangers in a strange land and our hearts will never be fully satisfied until we are back home with God. In any case, when people ask me my name I say, “Gulliver. Gulliver’s Travels, you know. He was my Great Uncle Lem.”",, ,172,Stanley Gulliver, , ,2.50,2,1,WB,May 10th 2012,Kindle Edition, ,2586-18219086-gulliver-s-travels-autobiography.html

You have created a new and fascinating world of colour that can be used in the arts and sciences to reveal the texture of life, to teach, to educate and to inform. But most important is its adaptation to an art form. You, more than any man living, have accomplished that. For tens of millions of people you have held a mirror up to nature and brought colour into their lives and into their world... ...The title ""Mr. Technicolor"" is just about right. Give your heart the fluid of your thoughts and let your intellect drive your pen. Open the doors to intimacy. Tells us what influenced your thoughts and actions, what created your lust for life... I suspect your material success was tempered with a will not to submit to a problem unsolved... that your joy or pleasure came from the solution itself. Tell us these things.

At an early age, he set off on a remarkable journey of austere self-education across the length and breadth of Britain's Indian Empire, halting at places connected with Buddhism. He went to Sri Lanka to master Pali, lived in a Burmese cave as a bhikshu, and even reached Nepal and Sikkim after arduous, sometimes barefoot, treks. Over those itinerant years, Dharmanand acquired such mastery of the Buddhist canon that he taught and researched at Calcutta, Baroda, Harvard and Leningrad. Dharmanand blended Buddhist ethics, Gandhi's philosophy and the ideals of socialism. He exchanged letters withthe Mahatma, worked for his causes and died in the approved Buddhist/Jain manner by voluntary starvation at Sevagram Ashram. No Indian scholar's life seems as exemplary as Dharmanand's or has approximated as closely to the nobility and saintliness of Mahatma's. Meera Kosambi's annotations and introduction contextualize the life, career and achievement of one of modern India's greatest scholar-savants.",8178243253, ,192,Meera Kosambi, , ,5.00,2,2,Permanent Black,2011,Paperback,English,2600-17881553-nivedan.html

1783,The Doctor's House: An Autobiography,"This is an unconventional autobiography of one of Ireland's most engaging and independent poets. In the first section, James Liddy describes his early life in Co. Wexford. His father was a Dispensary doctor, and his mother was an American from New York. Liddy's poetic prose style conveys a sense of living in both past and present. His love of the unusual, and a striving for intellectual freedom, propelled him, as a student in Dublin, to become one of the literary mandarins who made McDaid's pub the centre of Irish literary life. Patrick and Katherine Kavanagh, John Jordan, Richard Riordain, and Michael Hartnett figured largely in his life at that time, as did American writers Edward Dahlberg and Anthony Kerrigan. James Liddy was a member of a new generation of writers in the 1960s; this book gives the flavour of this sparkling period. The final chapters, his pivotal move to America, his adventures in San Francisco, New Orleans, and the German-American dream city of Milwaukee, mark the development of his poetry and his ever present sense of fun and intellectual exploration.",190339239X,9781903392393,144,James Liddy, , ,4.00,2,0,Salmon Publishing,March 1st 2005,Paperback,English,2602-576473.The_Doctor_s_House.html
1784,Boy from Bethulie: An Autobiography,"""Boy from Bethulie"" is a major theatrical autobiography, which is both funny and breathtakingly honest. Part history of mainstream South African theatre from the 1950s and part social documentary of the communities Mynhardt has played to--sophisticated audiences in ostentatious national theatres; rural audiences in tiny, ill-equipped and draughty halls in desolate platteland towns and villages; business executives in bomas in the bush--the book focuses a spotlight on the people and places intricately linked with the actor's life. Mynhardt is searingly honest, but the honesty is tempered with a self-deprecating humor that more often than not makes him the butt of his own jokes. In the words of the author, """"My Boy from Bethulie began to take shape in theatre dressing rooms, in hotels, in pubs, and parties a These occasions were the scene of my impromptu raconteur performances, unplanned and quite unrehearsed, given the spontaneity of immediate recollection."""" Mynhardt's storytelling skills that turned his childhood memories into the extraordinarily successful show Boy from Bethuli, translate easily onto the page and cover all aspects of his life. But most of all, the book reveals the many parts of the man who has come to be known as South Africa's Laurence Olivier. ""Boy from Bethulie's first half is a rich evocation of a period and of a wry, humane sensibility u Myrnhardt includes others in his pleasure of recollection."" --Robert Greig, ""Business Day"" ""Wherever Patrick went and whatever he said or did, Bethulie followed him with interest and admiration."" --Rums van Rensburg, Mayor of Bethulie",186814397X,9781868143979,448,Patrick Mynhardt, , ,3.67,3,1,Witwatersrand University Press Publications,August 1st 2004,Paperback,English,2603-3774383-boy-from-bethulie.html

From Bodley’s early education in Calvinist Switzerland to his studies at Oxford and his later career as one of Queen Elizabeth’s elite ambassadors, The Life of Sir Thomas Bodley is a rare look at the life of a thoroughly European man.

1801,Mr. Technicolor: An Autobiography,"Kay Harmon, managing director of Technicolor Corporation's British facility wrote to Dr. Herbert T. Kalmus upon learning of his plan to write an autobiographical account of the development of Technicolor:. ...You have created a new art form and I acclaim it so and reject any accusation of vanity. You have created a new and fascinating world of colour that can be used in the arts and sciences to reveal the texture of life, to teach, to educate and to inform. But most important is its adaptation to an art form. You, more than any man living, have accomplished that. For tens of millions of people you have held a mirror up to nature and brought colour into their lives and into their world... ...The title ""Mr. Technicolor"" is just about right. Give your heart the fluid of your thoughts and let your intellect drive your pen. Open the doors to intimacy. Tells us what influenced your thoughts and actions, what created your lust for life... I suspect your material success was tempered with a will not to submit to a problem unsolved... that your joy or pleasure came from the solution itself. Tell us these things. This, then, is Dr. Kalmus' attempt to answer the plea, detailing the happenstance as well as the single-minded perseverance that led to the fulfillment of his life-long quest to bring color to the motion picture screens of the world. For reasons known only to ""The Doctor,"" as Herbert Kalmus was affectionately known, he chose to leave out of his account any mention of his first marriage to Natalie Kalmus. Natalie played a major role in his life for decades both as the color consultant for Technicolor and as his adversary in what became a legendary divorce battle.

1802,Fathers and Sons: The Autobiography of a Family,"If there is a literary gene, then the Waugh family most certainly has it—and it clearly seems to be passed down from father to son. The first of the literary Waughs was Arthur, who, when he won the Newdigate Prize for poetry at Oxford in 1888, broke with the family tradition of medicine. He went on to become a distinguished publisher and an immensely influential book columnist. He fathered two sons, Alec and Evelyn, both of whom were to become novelists of note (and whom Arthur, somewhat uneasily, would himself publish); both of whom were to rebel in their own ways against his bedrock Victorianism; and one of whom, Evelyn, was to write a series of immortal novels that will be prized as long as elegance and lethal wit are admired. Evelyn begat, among seven others, Auberon Waugh, who would carry on in the family tradition of literary skill and eccentricity, becoming one of England’s most incorrigibly cantankerous and provocative newspaper columnists, loved and loathed in equal measure. And Auberon begat Alexander, yet another writer in the family, to whom it has fallen to tell this extraordinary tale of four generations of scribbling male Waughs. The result of his labors is Fathers and Sons , one of the most unusual works of biographical memoir ever written. In this remarkable history of father-son relationships in his family, Alexander Waugh exposes the fraught dynamics of love and strife that has produced a succession of successful authors. Based on the recollections of his father and on a mine of hitherto unseen documents relating to his grandfather, Evelyn, the book skillfully traces the threads that have linked father to son across a century of war, conflict, turmoil and change. It is at once very, very funny, fearlessly candid and exceptionally moving—a supremely entertaining book that will speak to all fathers and sons, as well as the women who love them.",0385521502,9780385521505,480,Alexander Waugh, , ,3.93,180,44,Nan A.

The book explores how readers responded to, and improvised with, four forms the almanac, the financial account, the commonplace book and the parish register to create written records of their lives. Early modern autobiography took place across these varied forms, often through a lengthy process of transmission and revision of written documents.

Familiar with all the great figures of the age, Berlioz paints brilliant portraits of Liszt, Wagner, Balzac, Weber, and Rossini, among others.

1815,"The Lady Tars: The Autobiographies of Hannah Snell, Mary Lacy and Mary Anne Talbot","Out of Print for over 200 Years, the original text of three of the most remarkable naval biographies ever written. We know that women served as sailors in the Royal Navy as early as 1650. Unfortunately, what little we know of these women is based largely on second- and third-hand accounts and deductions. In general, few seamen (and even fewer sea-women) knew how to write. As a result, there exists no first-hand, autobiographical, accounts-with three exceptions. Three women-three lady tars-left memoirs of their experiences serving as men in the Royal Navy. Hanna Snell (1723-1792) originally joined the army but deserted over a brutally unfair punishment to which she was subject. She then joined the marines and was wounded several times at the Battle of Pondicherry. Later she capitalized on the success of her autobiography by launching a stage career in which she would appear in her uniform doing military drills and singing patriotic songs. Mary Lacy (1740-1773+) ran away from home when she was 19, and became a carpenter's servant on several Royal Navy ships. After four years at sea she applied to be an apprentice shipwright. Seven years later, after dodging several brushes with discovery, she became the only known, fully credentialed, female shipwright of that era. Mary Ann Talbot (1778-1808) started her career in the army disguised as a boy servant to an officer.

1830,Blessed Hope: The Autobiography of John F. Walvoord,"...he has kept the "" blessed hope"" of the pretribulational Rapture alive and well. It would be impossible to write the history of the evangelical church of the last half of the twentieth century without giving Dr. John Walvoord a prominent position. For more than sixty years he has stood, without apology, for the literal interpretation of all Scripture, particularly Bible prophecy. More than any other one man he has kept the ""blessed hope"" of the pretribulational Rapture alive and well. As president of Dallas Theological Seminary for forty years, he guided the training of more young ministers than any other person in America. He brought together one of the most qualified seminary faculties ever assembled. Names like Charles Ryrie, Dwight Pentecost, Merrill F.Unger, and Stanley Toussaint-all men committed to the literal interpretation of the Word of God and the literal, physical return of Christ to set up His millennial kingdom. Dr. Walvoord's writings, particularly on prophetic subjects, are interesting yet scholarly, inspiring while not being Christian while at the same time meaningful to the Bible scholar. He is one of the most quoted pretribulational writers in the world. Today's church owes a great debt to this man. Anyone who emphasizes the imminent coming of Christ, as has Dr. Walvoord, has helped to fire the spirit of holiness, evangelism, and missionary vision in the hearts of pastors and believers. Dr. John Walvoord has done for the present-generation church what John Nelson Darby did in the nineteenth century-he has kept the torch of prophetic expectation alive and well in the hearts of missions.

1843,The Easy Way to Write An Autobiography That Sells,"Rob Parnell - the ""world’s foremost writing guru"" and Kindle bestselling author of the Easy Way to Write series, presents a complete manual on how to write your own autobiography - even if you’ve never written a word before! Have you ever wanted to record your life for your kids or your grandchildren? Do you want to tell your life story for fun, even profit? Ever wanted just to make sense of your life through the written word? Whatever your level of expertise, Rob Parnell will show you how you can easily turn your life story into a manuscript to love and cherish, or even sell on Amazon or submit to publishers. Life has a way of catching up with us. One moment we're living it up, in the prime of our lives, carefree, full of joy at possibilities, the next, we wonder where all that time went! We like to think we grow wiser and more informed as we age. So why is it nobody wants to listen to us? It's about context. We may have a lot of important, fascinating and profound things to say to people, based on our wealth of experience - but most times, it never seems quite appropriate to tell others how we think, what we've learned over the years, and how they might benefit from what we know. Unless it's within the context of writing. In your own autobiography, you have free rein, You can entertain, enthrall, dazzle and perhaps most of all, teach others the profound truths you have encountered on your journey through life. Writing your own autobiography is not just a dry recitation of facts about the events in your life, it's an opportunity to explore one of the most diverse and exciting of all subjects: YOU! Everyone is unique. Everyone has a different perspective. Everyone has something important to say, to record for posterity. Most of all, everyone has a right, perhaps even a duty to record their lives for the benefit of others. Writing your own autobiography can be an immensely cathartic experience. For perhaps the first time in your life, you can look back and make sense of everything you've done, everything you've achieved. Even failure can teach us valuable lessons if we make the effort to catalog our lives into meaningful stories. Along the way, you may even discover your true purpose, and how close you are to fulfilling your destiny - spiritually and materially. Do you want the world to experience your loves and losses first hand? Do you want to tell the story of an ancient family feud, or forever unearth that dark secret from your past? Do you want to tell the story of how you became rich and successful? How you fought the odds and won? Or do you just want to relate your childhood - in all its wonder. Or to re-imagine your experience of life during boom, bust, peace and wartime? Even if you've never written very much before, Rob Parnell will show how to write smooth and effective prose that will sparkle! He will show you what to focus on and why, because writing life stories is not just about the facts, it's also about how you tell the story.

1854,Telling Lies in Modern American Autobiography,"All autobiographers are unreliable narrators. Yet what a writer chooses to misrepresent is as telling -- perhaps even more so -- as what really happened. Timothy Adams believes that autobiography is an attempt to reconcile one's life with one's self, and he argues in this book that autobiography should not be taken as historically accurate but as metaphorically authentic. Adams focuses on five modern American writers whose autobiographies are particularly complex because of apparent lies that permeate them. In examining their stories, Adams shows that lying in autobiography, especially literary autobiography, is not simply inevitable. Rather it is often a deliberate, highly strategic decision on the author's part. Throughout his analysis, Adams's standard is not literal accuracy but personal authenticity. He attempts to resolve some of the paradoxes of recent autobiographical theory by looking at the classic question of design and truth in autobiography from the underside -- with a focus on lying rather than truth.

1857,In the Arena: An Autobiography,"Looking back over a career that has spanned half a century and a lifetime devoted to being the best possible, both as an actor and as a man, Charlton Heston writes of what it was like to live In the Arena. Heston began his career as an actor in New York shortly after he returned from service in World War II. Television was a fledgling industry then, and there were many opportunities for young performers in this new medium. Broadway was thriving as well, and Heston found work there too. It was not long, however, before Hollywood took note of his talents and his commanding presence. Soon he was embarked on a series of films that were both memorable and hugely successful. He was Moses in The Ten Commandments; he played the title character in Ben-Hur (for which he won an Academy Award); he was Michelangelo in The Agony and the Ecstasy; he played the title character in El Cid; he has played presidents, generals, and statesmen. In recent years, Heston has continued to appear in films, on stage, and on television, but at the same time, he has devoted a great amount of his energy to causes in which he has strong and outspoken beliefs. An active supporter of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in the early days of the struggle for civil rights in America, he continues to this day to lobby hard for the rights of all men to live family and equally in a country that he loves dearly.",157297267X,9781572972674,592,Charlton Heston, , ,3.80,114,23,Berkley Trade,June 1st 1997,Paperback,English,267-122219.In_the_Arena.html

His career and story cover the period (1950-2000) during which world fisheries would explode from small boat coastal activities to distant water fleets of large vessels. World catches would increase over 300% after WWII and most of the worlds oceans and seas would be heavily exploited. Overfishing and impacts on coastal fisheries would lead the world community to seek new laws for the harvest of ocean fisheries and result in unilateral extension of national jurisdictions over ocean space. The growth of environmental movement in the later half of the 20th century would lead to conflicts between fishing and conservation groups resulting in changes in national and international fish policies. The book tracks many of these developments and DR Alverson's personal involvements and experiences during the traumatic period of world fishery expansion.

1862,Portrait in Oil: The Autobiography of Nubar Gulbenkian,"Nubar Sarkis Gulbenkian (1896-1972) was an Armenian business magnate and socialite born in the Ottoman empire. He wore a monocle with aplomb, and a fresh orchid every day - custom-dyed if nature did not already provide a color suitable to the occasion. He was rich beyond anyone's wildest dreams and enjoyed every penny of his fabulous fortune. He was equally at home sipping champagne in Buckingham Palace or riding a camel through a desert sandstorm. Who was he? Nubar Gulbenkian was the son and heir of the legendary Mr. Five Percent (5% was his personal share of all Middle East oil production). A genial man with the sexual mores of a Turkish pasha and the impeccable manners of an Oxford gentleman, Gulbenkian wrote an elegantly self-mocking, vastly entertaining book. It is an inside view of the fantastic world of riches, where oil thickens international politics. It is also the memoir - never the apologia - of a happy man who was never thwarted in matters of love or money. With great charm and urbanity, Mr. Gulbenkian wrote of his idyllic childhood and his gilded youth, his stage-door liaisons and his marriages, his cloak-and-dagger mission to Vichy France, and his maneuverings in Big Oil. His character was summed up by an associate who claimed that ""Nubar is so tough that every day he tires out three stockbrokers, three horses and three women"".",, ,0,Nubar S.

But few fans, if any, could possibly identify with the anguish and turmoil that blighted his life. A staunch family man and loving father of four children, Dave's world was turned upside down when, while manager of Premier League Southampton, out of the blue he was charged with child abuse relating to his time working as a care worker. As he fought to clear his name from these totally false allegations, supported by his loyal wife Ann, who will also reveal her thoughts, Dave lost his job and, tragically, his father. What he didn't lose was his determination to tell his side of the story, even in the face of threats from those who sought to finish him. Now, in unprecedented detail, Dave reveals the effect the traumatic episode had on him and his family, identifies those he believes were responsible - and explains how, against all the odds, he picked up the pieces and resumed a highly successful managerial career.",1908051191,9781908051196,224,Dave Jones,Andrew Warshaw, ,3.83,6,0,Pitch Publishing,November 1st 2011,Paperback,English,2678-13225812-no-smoke-no-fire.html
1867,Out of Egypt: Scenes and Arguments of an Autobiography,"Like The Cross-Legged Scribe he de­scribes so vividly, Ihab Hassan lives under Medu-netcher, the sign of the word. For Hassan, a critic is far more than a conservator or maker of judgments. In his work he has investigated not only the state of current literature but the thoughts and feelings that inform it. “The important questions before the human race are not literary questions,” he acknowledges in Paracriticisms (1975). “They are questions of consciousness— reason, dream, love.” If humanity, as Hassan’s work progressively suggests, is being transformed by a new universal consciousness, it is appropriate, perhaps essential, that critics such as he examine their own evolution as thinking and feeling beings. Out of Egypt, Hassan has never returned, preferring instead the continuing journey: “In journeys, we hear the cadences of the uni­verse itself, and endure our death, going hence, coming hither. ‘Ripe­ness is all.’” The process of “ripen­ing” is dependent in this inter-textual age upon the blending of minds into minds, voices into voices, making it necessary for Hassan to weave into his nar­rative brief essays, citations, and quotations—including some from his previous work.",0809312964,9780809312962,128,Ihab Hassan, , ,3.00,2,0,Southern Illinois University Press,November 3rd 1986,Hardcover,English,2679-207074.Out_of_Egypt.html
1868,Take Me Home: An Autobiography,"In a career that has spanned twenty-five years, John Denver has earned international acclaim as a singer, songwriter, actor, and environmental activist. Songs like ""Take Me Home, Country Roads,"" ""Rocky Mountain High,"" and ""Annie's Song"" have entered the canon of universal anthems, but less than three decades ago, John Denver was a young man with little more than a fine voice, a guitar, and a dream. Growing up in a conservative military family, he was not expected to drop out of college and head to Los Angeles, where the music scene was flourishing. Nor was he expected to succeed. In Take Me Home, John Denver chronicles the experiences that shaped his life, while unraveling the rich, inner journey of a shy Midwestern boy whose uneasy partnership with fame has been one of the defining forces of his first fifty years. With candor and wit, John writes about his childhood, the experience of hitting L.A. as the Sixties roared into full swing, his first breaks, his years with the Mitchell Trio, his first songwriting success with ""Leaving on a Jet Plane,"" and finally a career that made his a global household name. He also explores his relationships with the women in his life - particularly his first wife, Annie Martell, and his second wife, Cassandra Delaney - as well as his parents, his children, his partners through his life, and his friends. Honest, insightful and rich in anecdotes that only a natural-born storyteller could tell so well, Take Me Home is a highly charged and fascinating book from beginning to end.

He identifies ways of speaking about oneself as a central arena of the Soviet revolution's drive for discovering, changing, and perfecting the self. The study is based on sources-many of which are no longer as freely accessible as they were during the heyday of the Soviet ""archival bonanza"" - in provincial party archives in Leningrad, Smolensk, and Tomsk. Its principal merit is Halfin's masterful handling and interpretation of those sources.

1874,From Fugitive Slave to Free Man: The Autobiographies of William Wells Brown,"Growing up as a slave in an urban area of Missouri allowed William Wells Brown to live a life that was different from that of the plantation slave so often discussed in slave histories. Born in 1814, the son of a white man and a slave woman, Brown spent the first twenty years of his life mainly in St. Louis and the surrounding areas working as a house servant, a field hand, a tavern keeper’s assistant, a printer’s helper, an assistant in a medical office, and a handyman for James Walker, a Missouri slave trader. During his time with Walker, Brown made three trips up and down the Mississippi River. These trips allowed him to encounter slavery from every perspective and provided experiences he would draw on throughout his writing career. In From Fugitive Slave to Free Man , two of Brown’s best-known writings, Narrative of William W. Brown, A Fugitive Slave. Written by Himself and My Southern Home: or, The South and Its People, are reprinted together with an expanded introduction by William L. Andrews. Brown’s Narrative, published in 1847, was his first autobiographical writing and was received with wide acclaim, going through four American and five British editions. Only Frederick Douglass’s autobiography sold better, casting a constant shadow over Brown’s works. Douglass and his life were touted as extraordinary, while Brown was referred to as the typical “every man’s slave.” However, the life of William Brown and his writings prove otherwise. Determined to be a man of letters, Brown was the first African American to write a travel book, Three Years in Europe: or, Places I Have Seen and People I Have Met , which was based on his time abroad in Paris at an international peace conference and in England on an anti-slavery crusade. A year later he published Clotel , the first novel written by an African American and the first to exploit the decades-old rumors of an affair between President Thomas Jefferson and his slave Sally Hemmings. Between 1854 and 1867, Brown published the first drama by an African American, The Escape: or, A Leap for Freedom, and two volumes of black history, one of which is the first military history of the African American in the United States. In 1880, Brown wrote his final autobiography, My Southern Home. In it he endeavors to explain the complex interrelationships between blacks and whites in the South. Taken together, both of the books included in this volume provide fascinating contrasts, especially in their depictions of slavery, and illustrate the creative innovations Brown developed in various forms of life writing—some of which were more experimental than Douglass’s and more prophetic of the future of African American literature.",0826214754,9780826214751,320,William Wells Brown,William L.

1875,The Evangelical Conversion Narrative: Spiritual Autobiography in Early Modern England,"In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, thousands of ordinary women and men experienced evangelical conversion and turned to a certain form of spiritual autobiography to make sense of their lives. This book traces the rise and progress of conversion narrative as a unique form of spiritual autobiography in early modern England. After outlining the emergence of the genre in the seventeenth century and the revival of the form in the journals of the leaders of the Evangelical Revival, the central chapters of the book examine extensive archival sources to show the subtly different forms of narrative identity that appeared among Wesleyan Methodists, Moravians, Anglicans, Baptists, and others. Attentive to the unique voices of pastors and laypeople, women and men, Western and non-Western peoples, the book establishes the cultural conditions under which the genre proliferated.",0199245754,9780199245758,384,D.

1876,Funny Peculiar: The Autobiography,"In 2001, Will Young shot to fame as the first winner of Pop Idol .

From his experiences on Pop Idol , to coming out in the glare of the media spotlight, Will is open about both the highs and lows of his life.

1879,From a Name to a Number: A Holocaust Survivor's Autobiography,"Alter Wiener's father was brutally murdered on September 11, 1939 by the German invaders of Poland. Alter was then a boy of 13. At the age of 15 he was deported to Blechhammer, a Forced Labor Camp for Jews, in Germany. He survived five camps. Upon liberation by the Russian Army on May 9, 1945, Alter weighed 80 lbs as reflected on the book's cover. Alter Wiener is one of the very few Holocaust survivors still living in Portland, Oregon. He moved to Oregon in 2000 and since then he has shared his life story with over 800 audiences (as of April, 2013) in universities, colleges, middle and high schools, Churches, Synagogues, prisons, clubs, etc. He has also been interviewed by radio and TV stations as well as the press. Wiener's autobiography is a testimony to an unfolding tragedy taking place in WWII. Its message illustrates what prejudice may lead to and how tolerance is imperative. This book is not just Wiener's life story but it reveals many responses to his story. Hopefully, it will enable many readers to truly understand such levels of horror and a chance to empathize with the unique plight of the Holocaust victims.

1880,"Don't Flinch: Barry Alvarez, the Autobiography: The Story of Wisconsin's All-Time Winningest Coach","Despite inheriting a moribund college football program, and half-empty stadium, Barry Alvarez never compromised his values, never flinched ? even after a 1-10 first season ? and never stopped believing in his blue print for success at the University of Wisconsin. By establishing a solid foundation, adhering to fundamentals and demanding an uncommon toughness from his players, Alvarez became the architect of three Rose Bowl triumphs in the ?90s and became the school's all-time winningest football coach. While changing the culture of the sport on the Madison campus, raising expectations to heretofore unthinkable levels, Alvarez left an indelible mark on the Badgers during his 16 seasons on the sidelines. Not only did Alvarez take over a Big Ten footwipe and build the program into national prominence, but he sustained the success by sticking to a plan rooted to his upbringing in Western Pennyslvania and his exposure to three legendary coaches, Nebraska's Bob Devaney, Iowa's Hayden Fry and Notre Dame's Lou Holtz. In his autobiography ? Don't Flinch ? Alvarez talks about the lessons that he learned from his mentors, the hurdles that he had to overcome as a young assistant and high school coach, and the challenge of taking over his own college program while living in a fishbowl, especially from his family's perspective. Alvarez maps out a strategy and game plan for young coaches who are seeking to achieve similar goals, and he also talks about his future as Wisconsin athletics director, and the future of college football. Alvarez's story, told in Alvarez's candid, pull-no-punches style, is written by Madison Capital Times columnist Mike Lucas, who also doubles as the color analyst for Badgerfootball and basketball on the UW radio network. Lucas, a Beloit native, enrolled at Wisconsin in 1968, and wrote for the Badger Herald and Daily Cardinal before joining the Capital Times as a full-time writer in 1971. Along with national, regional and local writing awards, Lucas has twice been named Sportswriter of the Year in Wisconsin. Lucas is entering his 12th season on the radio network. In addition, he hosts a weekly radio talk show on WIBA and a weekly television show on UPN-14 and WISC-3 which is also seen in other markets around the state.",097587697X,9780975876978,260,Barry Alvarez,Mike Lucas,Lou Holtz,3.77,22,3,Kci Sports Publishing,September 1st 2006,Hardcover,English,2690-83966.Don_t_Flinch.html

That day she was sexually molested by her stepbrother, on a remote Tennessee farm. The abuse by her stepfather and stepbrothers didn't stop for another five years, until Sunny's mother loses her battle with cancer. When Sunny and her brother, Toby, are sent to live with their father and stepmother in Indianapolis, Sunny is once again thrown into an abusive environment where she endures abuse daily by her stepmother. Raped by her boyfriend while still in high school, Sunny has the first of her five children. To provide for her children, Sunny turns to dancing and then to working at a sauna. Caught up in the fast life, it isn't until Sunny is accused of prostitution that she truly changes her life-and comes clean with her past. Sunny turned her life around and is now a tireless advocate for men, women and youth exiting correctional institutions and fleeing domestic violence situations. ""Throwaway"" is not a word in Sunny's vocabulary. She believes if a person can get to the core of a problem, they can break through and bloom.

1883,My Life is in Your Hands & Take My Life: The Autobiographies of Eddie Cantor,"A giant in the history of American entertainment, Eddie Cantor (1892-1964) won over the American public time and time again, first on stage, bowling audiences over in the Ziegfeld Follies, then in films, on the radio, and on television. His career ran from Vaudeville to video making all stops in between. A tireless person even when not on the stage, Cantor helped found the March of Dimes, and was the first national president of the Screen Actor's Guild (SAG), the American Federation of Radio Artists (later AFTRA), and the Jewish Theatrical Guild. Yet another medium in which Cantor succeeded was print. He authored and co-authored several books that upheld his standing as one of America's leading comedians. My Life Is In Your Hands & Take My Life combines for the first time in a single volume two memoirs written in 1928 and 1957, in which Eddie remembers his beginnings as an orphan on the Lower East Side and his hard-won climb from poverty to the bright lights of Broadway. The book also contains a lost chapter in which Eddie recalls his reactions to the stock market crash of 1929, along with a new complete index, discography, and filmography. In My Life Is In Your Hands & Take My Life, Cantor's humor is as sharp as ever and his sentiment is 100% genuine. While not at all modest about his decades of public adoration, Cantor shows a willingness to laugh at his blunders (such as his second film, ""Special Delivery""), and to praise the many talented people with whom he collaborated. Along with telling the story of show business in the first half of the 20th century, Cantor also lets readers in on fond stories of his friends, from Jimmy Durante (who worked as a pianist in the Coney Island restaurant where Cantor was a singing waiter), to Ziegfeld alumni Will Rogers and W. C. Fields, to fellow entertainers Clara Bow and Fanny Brice.",0815410573,9780815410577,650,Eddie Cantor, , ,4.00,11,0,Cooper Square Publishers,September 12th 2000,Paperback,English,2693-571860.My_Life_is_in_Your_Hands_Take_My_Life.html

Winner of the Philippines' National Book Award for Poetry, Eileen R. Tabios has a reputation for uniquely melding ekphrasis and transcolonialism. This collection of poems, prose and visual poetry is her most overtly political work yet, referencing her roots as a ""Marcos Baby,"" a member of the generation that grew up under Ferdinand Marcos' dictatorship. On April 11, 2006, Filamore B. Tabios, Sr. died of brain cancer and its complications. In writing about her father, Eileen R. Tabios explores reconciliation with Ferdinand Marcos' legacy through deliberate empathy with the former Philippine dictator's daughter Imee; pays homage to Judas Iscariot whose Gospel, discovered during her vigil by her father's deathbed, reveals him to be the most loyal disciple, instead of greatest betrayer of Jesus Christ; meditates on the murder statistics of the 20th century's leading killers, from Idi Amin to Adolf Hitler; considers the global Filipina pen pal phenomena; and engages with Dante Aleghieri's Purgatorio.",0979241626,9780979241628,366,Eileen R.

1886,The Autobiography of María Elena Moyano: The Life and Death of a Peruvian Activist,"""Moyano’s life exemplifies the overwhelming obstacles that poor barrio women experience not only in Peru but also in other third world countries. This autobiographical book adds important information to several different disciplines: Latin American politics, feminism, sociology, and current Peruvian history. . . . Edmisten’s expertise is obvious in the scholarly introduction and readable translation.""—Mary H. Wilgus, Campbellsville University Using María Elena Moyano’s own words, the editor of this poignant story has re-created the voice of the martyred Peruvian activist. In 1992, at age 33, Moyano was assassinated by guerrillas of the revolutionary movement Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path). Her murder--a warning to others in the women’s movement--galvanized the Peruvian people against Sendero Luminoso and its leader, Abimael Guzmán Reynosa. In part 1 of this work, Moyano traces the struggle of poor women in Peru and how they developed survival organizations such as the Vaso de Leche (Glass of Milk) and the communal kitchen feeding program to cope with poverty made worse by government austerity adjustments. Like other women, Moyano honed her leadership skills in these programs. She condemned the terrorist tactics of Sendero Luminoso and publicly proclaimed that they were not on the side of the poor. She also condemned the human rights abuses of the military and police. In part 2, Moyano relates the hardships of her impoverished childhood and describes the difficulties of achieving an education. She speaks also of her marriage and of childbirth, of the discrimination she faced, and of her gradual and steady rise to positions of authority within the popular women’s movement and as deputy mayor and spokesperson for the 300,000 people of Villa El Salvador, a Lima barrio. As a woman of color, Moyano led a revolution of conscience within a larger revolution. Through this gracefully translated book, her voice continues to speak for all women who refuse to relinquish the struggle for dignity, freedom, and equal political participation. All royalties from this book will go to the Flora Tristán Center for the Peruvian Woman. Diana Miloslavish Tupac studied literature at the National University of San Marcos in Lima. She went to Mexico to participate in a study on ethnic minorities and human rights, and there she became a member of the Mexican Solidarity Committee for Guatemalan refugees. Upon her return to Peru, she rejoined the Flora Tristán Center for the Peruvian Woman. Patricia S. Taylor Edmisten is an independent scholar and retired professor of the sociological foundations of education at the University of West Florida. She has worked in Peru as a Peace Corps volunteer and as a consultant for the United Nations and is the author of Nicaragua Divided: La Prensa and the Chamorro Legacy (UPF, 1990).",0813027462,9780813027463,128,Diana M.

1887,Cyrille Regis: My Story: The Autobiography of the First Black Icon of British Football,"The autobiography of Britain's first black football superstar Cyrille Regis' story is a compelling one on many levels, including his migration from the French Caribbean to a racially divided West London in the 1960s; his development as a semi-professional footballer; his subsequent move to a top-flight Football League club—which brought national recognition and glory, yet found him still facing racial hatred; and his eventually receiving an MBE, recognition for his services to football and the community. This fascinating autobiography describes the battles Cyrille faced as a child and teenager before he turned professional and achieved great things as a footballer. As well as detailing the glorious moments in his career, it studies the impact that he and his black teammates had on the sociological outlook of football fans. It concludes with a review of Cyrille Regis' life after he retired as a footballer, and his work in the community.",0233003266,9780233003269,258,Cyrille Regis,David James, ,3.67,6,2,Andre Deutsch,November 1st 2011,Paperback,English,2697-13230071-cyrille-regis.html

Katharine Cornell today February, 1939 X Foreword Some seventeen years ago I was general assistant to Winthrop Ames when he produced The Green Goddess with George Arliss as its star at the Booth Theatre. In the ninth month of that plays run I married Katharine Cornell. A little over a month later she made her first big hit in A Bill of Divorcement. The night after she had received her glowing notices I had some business to at tend to backstage at the Booth. Mr. Arliss came out of his dressing-room and, instead of greeting me as usual, turned to Maude Ho well, the stage manager, and said Who is this young man And before she could reply, he adjusted his monocle, looked at me again and, with a malevolent foreboding chuckle, said Oh, of course, its Miss Cornells husband, That was a very happy thing to be then, anci after seventeen years it is still a very happy tiling to be.

1908,An Elastic State of Mind: D.L.D.'s autobiography in poems,"http://www.wigestrand.no/default.pl?s... D.L.D. er initialene til Dorothea Lynde Dix, en markant skikkelse i 1800-tallets USA (1802-1887). Hun satte sin signatur på en rekke reformer innenfor amerikansk skole-, helse- og fengselvesen, og hadde et stort sosialt og politisk engasjement for den fattige del av befolkningen. Med poetisk kraft, respekt og innlevelse forteller Ren Powell om D.L.D.'s perioder med depresjon og hypomanisk energi i en selvbiografi som romer to liv: dikterens og Dorothea Lynde Dix'. ""I performed the character of D.L.D. while writing. Like an actor using Stanislavski's Magic If, I inhabited the mind of the character and played out the scenes drawing upon my own sense memories--but I have slavishly followed the script, which is a sequence of scenes built with the artifacts of D.L.D.'s life, including her own letters and publications and statements of convictions. I have done my best to understand and respect her attitudes when they have differed fundamentally from my own. While I can't guarantee historical accuracy in every detail, I am confident that these poems are nonetheless true."" - Ren Powell in the foreword for An Elastic State of Mind.",, ,156,Ren Powell, , ,4.00,2,1,Wigestrand forlag,November 27th 2012,Hardcover,English,2716-16204329-an-elastic-state-of-mind.html

1911,The Importance of Being Awkward: The Autobiography of Tam Dalyell,"When veteran Labor MP Tam Dalyell retired as Father of the House in 2005, the Commons lost not only one of its most colorful and outspoken politicians, but also one of its most deeply principled members. In a parliamentary career that spanned 43 years and the administrations of eight Prime Ministers (from Macmillan to Blair), Dalyell was never a stranger to controversy. His vehemently independent and firmly-held views might have denied him a career on the front bench, but have ensured that his name has seldom been out of the headlines. An outspoken critic of both Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair, he famously harried the former over the sinking of the Belgrano during the Falklands conflict, and argued fiercely against the Gulf War of 1990 and the invasion of Iraq in 2003. He also spoke out against military action in Kosovo, and has been a leading figure in the attempt to uncover the truth about the Lockerbie bombing. In this memoir, based on personal papers as well as official documents—many of them only recently declassified—he looks back over a lifetime of dedicated service as MP for West Lothian and Linlithgow and talks of his family connections to the area: the Dalyells have lived at the historic House of the Binns, near Linlithgow, for almost 400 years. Insightful, witty and urbane, this is a fascinating book which offers a unique perspective on many of the key moments in Britain's political life over the last fifty years.",1841589934,9781841589930,288,Tam Dalyell, , ,3.67,3,1,Birlinn Ltd,August 1st 2011,Hardcover,English,2719-12778862-the-importance-of-being-awkward.html
1912,Modern Classics the Grass Arena: An Autobiography,"John Healy's The Grass Arena describes with unflinching honesty his experiences of addiction, his escape through learning to play chess in prison, and his ongoing search for peace of mind. This Penguin Classics edition includes an afterword by Colin MacCabe. In his searing autobiography Healy describes his fifteen years living rough in London without state aid, when begging carried an automatic three-year prison sentence and vagrant alcoholics prowled the parks and streets in search of drink or prey. When not united in their common aim of acquiring alcohol, winos sometimes murdered one another over prostitutes or a bottle, or the begging of money. Few modern writers have managed to match Healy's power to refine from the brutal destructive condition of the chronic alcoholic a story so compelling it is beyond comparison. John Healy (b. 1943) was born into an impoverished, Irish immigrant family, in the slums of Kentish Town, North London. Out of school by 14, pressed into the army and intermittently in prison, Healy became an alcoholic early on in life. Despite these obstacles Healy achieved remarkable, indeed phenomenal expertise in both writing and chess, as outlined in the autobiographical The Grass Arena.

Their performances engage issues of sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, loss of parent, disability, life and death, and war and peace.

1914,"The Red Grange Story: An Autobiography, as told to Ira Morton","Red Grange stood with Babe Ruth and Jack Dempsey in the 1920s as the most heralded figures in America's ""Golden Age of Sport."" Grantland Rice immortalized Grange in rhyme as ""The Galloping Ghost"" and named him and Jim Thorpe the halfbacks on his all-time college team. In 1991, when Sports Illustrated published its first special issue celebrating ""yesterday's heroes,"" Red Grange, ""An Original Superstar,"" was featured on the cover. A three-time All-American at the University of Illinois in 1923-25, Grange scored 31 touchdowns and ran for 3,637 yards in three eight-game seasons. In 1924 he gave what many consider to be the greatest single-game performance in the history of college football. Playing before 67,000 fans on the dedication day of Illinois' new Memorial Stadium, Grange scored four touchdowns in the first twelve minutes of play, ran for a fifth touchdown in the third quarter, and passed for a sixth touchdown in the final period. When Grange joined the Chicago Bears on Thanksgiving Day 1925, five days after his last college game, it marked the turning point for professional football. His enormous popularity and drawing power became the force that was to transform the NFL into a major sports attraction. This is the first paperback edition of Grange's autobiography, originally published in 1953 and praised by Robert Cromie of the Chicago Tribune as ""the literary equivalent of a perfectly planned and executed touchdown march."" Illustrated with more than a dozen photographs, it includes a new introduction and afterword by Ira Morton.",0252063295,9780252063299,224,Red Grange,Ira Morton, ,3.86,7,1,University of Illinois Press,August 1st 1993,Paperback, ,2721-61052.The_Red_Grange_Story.html

1919,"Boozing, Betting & Brawling: The Autobiography of Mel Sterland","Boozing, Betting & Brawling is the autobiography of former footballer, Mel Sterland, who played for Sheffield Wednesday, Glasgow Rangers and Leeds United. He was also capped once by England. The book which is co-authored by Sheffield-based journalist, Nick Johnson, opens with Sterland recounting plans to commit suicide after being forced into premature retirement from playing. Following an indifferent start to his career at Sheffield Wednesday, Sterland made his name as a marauding full-back, playing under high-profile managerial trio Jack Charlton, Howard Wilkinson and Ron Atkinson. He made a big-money move to Glasgow Rangers, where he played under another well-known football personality, Graeme Souness. Despite being at Ibrox for only a brief spell, Sterland is fondly remembered by Rangers fans for scoring the goals which helped the Glasgow giants win the first of a record-equalling nine league titles. Following his transfer to Leeds, where he played alongside the likes of Eric Cantona and Gordon Strachan, Sterland won a First Division championship-winner’s medal, making him one of only a handful of players to win the league title in both England and Scotland. Sterland’s story features a heady mix of humour, gambling and punch-ups, and will have widespread appeal to football supporters. In the interests of authenticity, no attempt has been made to smooth off the rough edges, creating an honest, raw account.",1906229708,9781906229702,240,Mel Sterland,Nick Johnson, ,3.14,7,3,Green Umbrella Publishing,August 11th 2008,Hardcover,English,2726-4530421-boozing-betting-brawling.html

1923,Unreasonable Behaviour: An Autobiography,"""McCullin is required reading if you want to know what real journalism is all about."" -- Times Literary Supplement From the construction of the Berlin Wall through every conflict up to the Falklands War, photographer Don McCullin has left a trail of iconic images. At the Sunday Times Magazine in the 1960s, McCullin's photography made him a new kind of hero. The flow of stories every Sunday took a generation of readers beyond the insularity of post-war Britain and into the recesses of domestic deprivation: when in 1968, a year of political turmoil, the Beatles wanted new pictures, they insisted on using McCullin; when Francis Bacon, whose own career had emerged with depiction of the ravages of the flesh, wanted a portrait, he turned to McCullin. McCullin now spends his days quietly in a Somerset village, where he photographs the landscape and arranges still-lifes -- a far cry from the world's conflict zones and the war-scarred north London of Holloway Road where his career began. In October 2015, it will be twenty-five years since the first publication of his autobiography, Unreasonable Behaviour -- a harrowing memoir combining his photojournalism with his lifework. The time is right to complete McCullin's story.

1928,A Very Private Eye: An Autobiography in Diaries and Letters (Bello),"‘Could one write a book based on one’s diaries over thirty years? I certainly have enough material,’ wrote Barbara Pym. This book, selected from the diaries, notebooks and letters of this much loved novelist to form a continuous narrative, is indeed a unique autobiography, providing a privileged insight into a writer’s mind. Philip Larkin wrote that Barbara Pym had ‘a unique eye and ear for the small poignancies of everyday life’. Her autobiography amply demonstrates this, as it traces her life from exuberant times at Oxford in the thirties, through the war when, scarred by an unhappy love affair, she joined the WRNS, to the published novelist of the fifties. It also deals with the long period when her novels were out of fashion and no one would publish them, her rediscovering in 1977, and the triumphant success of her last few years. It is now possible to describe a place, situation or person as ‘very Barbara Pym’. A Very Private Eye, at once funny and moving, shows the variety and depth of her own story.",, ,424,Barbara Pym, , ,3.93,160,14,Bello,November 21st 2013,Kindle Edition,English,2734-20502622-a-very-private-eye.html

1931,David Frost: An Autobiography part 1: From Congregations to Audiences,"David Frost is probably the most diverse, long-lasting and consistently innovatory performer the television age has produced. From his earliest days on That Was The Week That Was - the show which turned television in a completely new direction - to his later interviews of presidents and prime ministers, he has never been far from the centre of events. In the first part of his autobiography, he gives his own account of his childhood as the son of a Methodist minister, his appearances with the Cambridge Footlights, and the foundation of London Weekend Television and the business interests that have made him, in the words of one commentator, a 'one-man conglomerate'. But it is by his interviewing that Frost has made his greatest mark. The encounters he presents here, with figures as diverse as Robert Kennedy, Muhammad Ali, Enoch Powell and the Prince of Wales, show him to be one of television's most incisive interviewers. They also illuminate some of the greatest questions of his time - drugs, racism, the decline of religious faith - and capture the moods of Britain and America in the 1960s. Nobody who reads this wonderfully entertaining book can fail to be impressed by David Frost's energy and the impact he had on public life in the 1960s on both sides of the Atlantic. There emerges from it a figure who was not only made by his times, but in part made them.",0006380824,9780006380825,0,David Frost, , ,3.75,8,1,Basic Books (AZ),,Paperback,English,2737-1127664.David_Frost.html

""Leon Trotsky is trying to kill me,"" thinks Joseph Stalin. It's a paranoid lie, but all too real to Stalin. Trotsky, in exile in Mexico City, is writing a biography of Stalin that may offer proof of a secret crime that could force Stalin from power. What will Trotsky disclose before the long hand of Stalin reaches him and eliminates the threat? The prospect leads Stalin to reflect on his own life—the sly and domineering schoolboy battling a sadistic father . . . a youthful poet, thief, and seminarian who questions morality, evil, and the existence of God until he finds answers that free him to a life of power and slaughter. Stalin takes us deeper and deeper into his life and into the labyrinth of his psyche until we are finally alone with him.

Bicycling fifty miles in a day at the age of eleven, alone, it seems only natural that her first major journey should have been to cycle to India.",0140054480,9780140054484,236,Dervla Murphy, , ,3.97,148,12,Penguin Books,May 28th 1981,Paperback,English,2745-1419359.Wheels_within_Wheels.html
1941,Going Off Alarming: The Autobiography: Vol 2,"""In these memoirs I bounce all about British TV with such success that I wind up in radio. I will also be filling a few holes that I left in the previous decades. For example, I managed to forget in Book One that I had been shot. Twice."" Danny Baker's first volume of autobiography, Going to Sea in a Sieve , was a Sunday Times bestseller, acclaimed for its non-stop humor and anecdotal flourish. It told the exploits of Danny's childhood and the wild living of his teenage years. Now, he is 25 and it is 1982, and he embarks on an accidental and anxiety-induced career in television—going off alarming. With rollicking good stories from what he describes as ""a frankly crackpot life,"" Danny continues this stupendous chronicle with irrepressible verve and hilarity. Dozens of TV shows—many of them lousy—give up their backstage stories, and Danny's extraordinary family, particularly his father Spud, react to the ride throughout. Game shows, talk shows, adverts and TFI Friday are but a few of the unplanned pitstops along the way. Not forgetting the tale of Twizzle: the Dog Who Hanged Himself, Died, Then Came Back to Life Again. . . Clearly, this will be no ordinary show business-stroll down memory lane.",0297870114,9780297870111,272,Danny Baker, , ,4.31,167,28,Orion Publishing,September 1st 2014,Hardcover,English,2746-21074491-going-off-alarming.html

1945,Infinity Net: The Autobiography of Yayoi Kusama,"In 1957, encouraged by Georgia O’Keeffe, artist Yayoi Kusama left Japan for New York City to become a star. By the time she returned to her home country in 1973, she had established herself as a leader of New York’s avant-garde movement, known for creating happenings and public orgies to protest the Vietnam War and for the polka dots that had become a trademark of her work. Her sculptures, videos, paintings, and installations are to this day included in major international exhibitions. Available for the first time in English, Infinity Net paints a multilayered portrait of this fascinating artist. Taking us from her oppressive childhood in postwar Japan to her present life in the psychiatric hospital where she voluntarily stays—and is still productive—Kusama’s autobiography offers insight into the persona of mental illness that has informed her work. While she vibrantly describes the hallucinatory episodes she experiences, her tale is punctuated by stories of her pluck and drive in making her artistic voice heard. Conveying the breadth and ambition of her own work, Kusama also offers a dazzling snapshot of 1960s and 1970s New York City and her encounters with its artists—she collaborates with Andy Warhol, shares an apartment with Donald Judd, and becomes romantically entangled with Joseph Cornell. Replete with the sense of the sheer necessity within an artist to create, Infinity Net is an energetic and juicy page-turner that offers a glimpse into Kusama’s exhilarating world.",0226464989,9780226464985,256,Yayoi Kusama,Ralph McCarthy, ,3.96,166,18,University Of Chicago Press,January 30th 2012,Hardcover,English,275-11916354-infinity-net.html

Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1866 edition. Excerpt: ... AUTOBIOGKAPHY OF GEOEGE EASTON. In laying before my numerous friends, at the request of a few of them, a brief account of my life in connection 'with the Temperance Movement, I do not feel that any apology is necessary; as it is chiefly for the purpose of having an opportunity of defending the principles upon which the movement is based, and of illustrating the benefits it is fitted to confer, that I have undertaken the task. Indeed, apart from the temperance movement, there is nothing in my history of deeper interest than may be found in that of the great majority of mankind. Like most other men born in humble life, I can say very little of my progenitors. In these circumstances the reflection is somewhat consoling, that I am certainly descended from the great progenitors of the race, and can therefore claim connection with as ancient a family as any king, lord, or duke on the face of the earth. Had there been, over and above the ordinary ties of nature, a substantial chain of the precious metal, ornamented with costly diamonds, binding my forefathers to one another, it is more than probable I would have been able to trace them back many generations; but B 2 BIRTH. the fact that I cannot go back more than two is a very satisfactory proof that no such chain ever existed. Well, be it so, -- "" A man's a man for a' that."" But to my narrative. My grandfather and mother, on my father's side, were natives of Selkirkshire. Neither of these had I ever the pleasure of seeing. My respected father, James Easton,""the eldest of a family of seven, was engaged about 1790 by Sir Charles Malcolm, Burnfoot, parish of Westerkirk, as his body servant.

Sean Og O hAilpin became synonymous with Cork hurling during a period when the Rebel County reached the highest of highs and was regularly gripped by controversy. Making his trademark barnstorming solo runs from left wing-back, Sean Og emerged as the lynchpin of the great group of Cork hurlers that won five Munster titles and three All-Irelands; in 1999 he contested All-Ireland finals in both codes. He was also central in standing up for players' rights against the Cork county board - a source of great controversy and two painful strikes. Now, Sean Og tells his own story in his own words - a story every GAA fan has been waiting to read. Full of frank insights, Sean Og's autobiography is not just an essential sporting story; it is an essential Irish story.

1956,Tallulah: My Autobiography,"Biography ] Performing Arts Her father and her uncle were U.S. congressmen. Her grandfather was a U.S. senator. Although born to privilege in Alabama and groomed in a convent school, Tallulah Bankhead resolved not to be just another southern belle. Quickly she rose to the top and became an acclaimed actress of London's West End and on the Broadway stage. Her performances in many plays of the 1920s brought her to the notice of Hollywood. She starred in such Paramount films as ""My Sin,"" ""Faithless,"" ""The Devil and the Deep,"" and ""Thunder Below."" Even though she won a New York Film Critics Circle Award for her leading role in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Lifeboat"" (1944), she never achieved the prominence in movies that she enjoyed in the theater and on radio. On the New York stage she originated the starring roles of Regina Giddens in Lillian Hellman's ""The Little Foxes"" and of Sabina in Thornton Wilder's ""The Skin of Our Teeth."" Tallulah, like Eudora, Flannery, and Coretta, was a southern woman identifiable by her first name. Her flamboyant public personality may be the most fully realized and memorable character Bankhead ever played. She became famous for her snappy repartee, candid quotes, and scandalous lifestyle. She was disposed to remove her clothes and chat in the nude. Overfond of Kentucky bourbon and wild parties, she was a lady baritone who called everybody ""Dahling."" In ""Tallulah,"" first published in 1952 and a New York Times bestseller for twenty-six weeks, Bankhead's literary voice is as lively and forthright as her public persona. She details her childhood and adolescence, discusses her dedication to the theater, and presents amusing anecdotes about her life in Hollywood, New York, and London. Along with a searing defense of her lifestyle and rambunctious habits, she provides a fiercely opinionated, wildly funny account of American stage at a time when the movies were beginning to cast theater into eclipse. This is not only a memoir of an independent woman but also an insider look at American entertainment during a golden age. Tallulah Bankhead (1902D1968) headlined NBC's ""The Big Show,"" a ninety-minute weekly radio extravaganza that aired from 1950 to 1952. In 1965 she appeared in her last movie, a British film titled ""Fanatic"" (""Die, Die, My Darling!"" in U.S. release).""",1578066352,9781578066353,341,Tallulah Bankhead, , ,3.74,125,8,University Press of Mississippi,July 7th 2004,Paperback,English,276-700030.Tallulah.html

In the book, he talks about his ups and downs at McLaren, the reputation he gained for his playboy lifestyle and how hard this has made it for him to settle down. Throughout it all he seeks to answer the questions about himself that anyone might ask, and so to reveal what it is that really drives him on.

1987,Autobiography,"The analysis of life-writing as a distinct and specialized project emerged only in the second half of the twentieth century. That it has achieved both academic respectability and critical cachet over the last twenty-five years is the result of a number of trends. Politically 'progressive' tendencies, from the civil rights, workers' educational and second-wave women's movements, to the establishment of sociology, social history and interdisciplinary women's and 'race' studies, have appealed to 'experience', via the production and dissemination of personal testimony, life-narratives, autobiographical manifestos, as the basis for consciousness-raising and as a challenge to dominant accounts of the social world. At the same time, paradoxically, neo-conservative celebrations of individual choice, personal entitlement, consumer power, have reinstated the 'unique' self and its representation at the heart of many late-capitalist cultures. This collection covers all of these schools of thought and brings together both 'mainstream' and 'dissident' theorists, authors and texts. With a new introduction by the editor, an index and a chronological table of contents, this collection will be a unique and unrivalled research resource for both student and scholar.",0415348714,9780415348713,4,Trev Lynn Broughton, , ,0.00,0,0,Routledge,December 1st 2006,Hardcover,English,2788-13709785-autobiography.html

1992,Voices In The Mirror: An Autobiography,"Alone after his mother’s death, homeless in a Minnesota winter, young Gordon struggled to stay in school, working at menial jobs and riding streetcars all night to escape the cold. Refusing to succumb to despair, he instead transformed his anger at poverty and racism into a creative force and went on to break down one barrier after another. He was the first black photographer at Vogue and Life, and the first black screenwriter and director in Hollywood, at the helm of such projects as the award-winning Shaft . And his novel, The Learning Tree, has sold more than a quarter of a million copies. Spanning the major events of five decades, Voices in the Mirror takes readers from Minnesota and Washington, D.C., to the glamour of Paris and the ghettos of Rio and Harlem. His intimate portrayals of Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini; of the Muslim and African American icons Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad and Muhammad Ali; of the young militants of the civil rights and black power movements; and of the tragic experiences of the less famous, like the Brazilian youngster Flavio, combine to form an unforgettable story. Gordon Parks’s life is a metaphor for the courageous vision and extraordinary resilience of the African American community, while also serving as a testament to the spirit and generosity that are its hallmarks.",, ,351,Gordon Parks, , ,4.31,58,5,Doubleday & Compan,November 1990,Hardcover,English,2792-7797302-voices-in-the-mirror.html
1993,The Abandoned Baobab: The Autobiography of a Senegalese Woman,"The subject of intense admiration--and not a little shock, when it was first published-- ""The Abandoned Baobab"" has consistently captivated readers ever since. The book has been translated into numerous languages and was chosen by QBR Black Book Review as one of Africa's 100 best books of the twentieth century. No African woman had ever been so frank, in an autobiography, or written so poignantly, about the intimate details of her life--a distinction that, more than two decades later, still holds true. Abandoned by her mother and sent to live with relatives in Dakar, the author tells of being educated in the French colonial school system, where she comes gradually to feel alienated from her family and Muslim upbringing, growing enamored with the West. Academic success gives her the opportunity to study in Belgium, which she looks upon as a ""promised land."" There she is objectified as an exotic creature, however, and she descends into promiscuity, alcohol and drug abuse, and, eventually, prostitution. (It was out of concern on her editor's part about her candor that the author used the pseudonym Ken Bugul, the Wolof phrase for ""the person no one wants."") Her return to Senegal, which concludes the book, presents her with a past she cannot reenter, a painful but necessary realization as she begins to create a new life there. As Norman Rush wrote in the ""New York Times Book Review, "" ""One comes away from ""The Abandoned Baobab"" reluctant to take leave of a brave, sympathetic, and resilient woman."" Despite its unflinching look at our darkest impulses, and at the stark facts of being a colonized African, the book is ultimately inspirational, for it exposes us to a remarkable sensibility and a hard-won understanding of one's place in the world.

Although he had inherited an important historic medicine bundle, he was not a hereditary civil chief of the Sauk, but was an appointed war chief. He was generally known in English as Black Hawk. During the War of 1812, he fought on the side of the British. Later he led a band of Sauk and Fox warriors against settlers in Illinois and present-day Wisconsin in the 1832 Black Hawk War. After the war he was captured and taken to the eastern U. S. where he and other British Band leaders toured several cities.

The eighteen year old from Kansas was following in the footsteps of innumerable young men before him; join the Navy and see the world. He looked for excitement, adventure, and possessed a yearning to escape the too-familiar confines of pre-Brown-vs-Board-of-Education Topeka.

Upon graduation, he was commissioned a 2d Lieutenant in the Marine Corps, becoming the first African American pilot in the history of that elite organization.

1997,Push Comes to Shove: An Autobiography,"An electrifying performer and one of the greatest choreographers of her time, Twyla Tharp is also an intensely private woman whose supremely inventive dances have spoken for her, revealing a spirit full of joy and pain, contradictions and questions - and answers. Now, in her own words, Twyla Tharp offers a rare and provocative glimpse into the mind and heart behind her famously deadpan face. Much more than a dance book, Push Comes to Shove is the story of a woman coming to terms with herself as daughter, wife and lover, mother, artist. A child of Indiana Quaker country, Twyla Tharp was traumatically uprooted to California when her stage-ambitious mother built a drive-in movie theater. Soon Twyla was studying piano, violin, flamenco, drums, French, baton twirling, tap, classical ballet...But it was in adolescence - tangling with a rattlesnake in the California desert and observing overheated couples in the backs of cars - that she began to learn the powers of the body and the erotic mysteries of dance. In New York her raw talent came under the influence of such giants as Martha Graham, Paul Taylor, Merce Cunningham, and George Balanchine. But Tharp fought to find her own vision as an artist. In the process she created a new vocabulary of movement: quirky rebellious, sexy, comic - a daring and defiant marriage of Jelly Roll Morton, Bach, the modern dance, and classical ballet. Her collaborations with Mikhail Baryshnikov, Jerome Robbins, director Milos Forman, and David Byrne of Talking Heads built bridges between ballet audiences and fans of popular culture. Now with a stunning accompaniment of photographs by Richard Avedon and others, she reveals the development of the Tharp style - the rendering of order out of chaos, and chaos out of conventional order - that won critical acclaim in such works as Deuce Coupe, The Fugue, Push Comes to Shove, In the Upper Room, and the movies Hair and Amadeus. But her spectacular success did not come without personal anguish.

2000,What If I Had Never Tried It: The Autobiography,"What If I had Never Tried It is the first autobiography of arguably the world's greatest motorcycle road racing champion, Valentino Rossi. Certainly he is the greatest in modern times and similarly the best loved. This is the official, personal story: fast paced yet insightful. Rossi’s record in the motorcycle road racing World Championship is supreme. First in the ultra-competitive 125 class starting in 1996; then in the 250 class only to graduate shortly thereafter to the big league of the 500s. In 2002 the premier class switched direction moving from 500 cc two-strokes to 990 cc four-strokes from then on to be known as MotoGP. Rossi rides for Honda and wins. He wins on a Honda the next year and then switches to Yamaha, to every race fans’ surprise, and wins against all odds. He wins again in 2005. No one is close. No one is faster. And all at speeds which approach 200 mph. Both on and off-track, on the ubiquitous TV screen or walking in the street, Rossi is idolized as though he were a rock star. From his native Italy to California, from Philips Island to Laguna Seca, he has raised the limits, reshaped the frontiers of the sport and set new trends. Rossi has become the 21st Century face of motorcycle road racing. Yet he remains faithful to himself—one moment the intelligent, articulate interviewee; the next a jokester; the next the single-minded, focused, strategic racer with split-second skills the rest of us can only dream of.",0760326827,9780760326824,288,Valentino Rossi, , ,4.01,498,61,Motorbooks,April 9th 2006,Hardcover,English,280-1061188.What_If_I_Had_Never_Tried_It.html

2004,"Autobiography and Selected Letters, Volume II: Letters 51-193","A professing pagan in an aggressively Christian empire, a friend of the emperor Julian and acquaintance of St. Basil, a potent spokesman for private and political causes--Libanius can tell us much about the tumultuous world of the fourth century. Born in Antioch to a wealthy family steeped in the culture and religious traditions of Hellenism, Libanius rose to fame as a teacher of the classics in a period of rapid social change. In his lifetime Libanius was an acknowledged master of the art of letter writing. Today his letters--about 1550 of which survive--offer an enthralling self-portrait of this combative pagan publicist and a vivid picture of the culture and political intrigues of the eastern empire. A. F. Norman selects one eighth of the extant letters, which come from two periods in Libanius's life, 355-365 and 388-393 CE, letters written to Julian, churchmen, civil officials, scholars, and his many influential friends. The ""Letters"" are complemented, in this two-volume edition, by Libanius's ""Autobiography"" (""Oration"" 1), a revealing narrative that begins as a scholar's account and ends as an old man's private journal.

Dismissal of the band--Count Durazzo--My journey to Italy with Gluck -- Marini -- Sojourn in Venice and Bologna--Farinelli--Nicolini and the blind beggar-- A deputation--Father Martin--Panic--Hurried return to Vienna--Lolli and I are rivals. The Prince, my patron, was great-uncle of the reigning Duke of Sachsen Hildburghausen, who died about this time, --the hereditary successor to the Dukedom being a child between six and seven years of age. The result was, that not only the guardianship of the ward devolved upon the Prince, but the administration and government of the Duchy as well. He willingly undertook both offices, and moved to Hildburghausen accordingly. As he found an orchestra ready made at this Court, and as he had his hands full with the education of the hereditary Prince and the administration of the estate, he felt obliged to dismiss the greater part of his own band. To prevent their losing a livelihood, he agreed with Count Durazzo, then the chief director of the Court Theatre, that we should be taken on by him. The contract bound us for three years' service, during which we were obliged to play in the Opera House and at Court, for the same pay that we had received in the Prince's service. No one suffered more than I did by this arrangement, for I had to play almost daily from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at operatic and ballet rehearsals, not to mention theatrical performances from 6.30 to 10.30 of an evening, as well as accompanying at the theatrical concerts, and playing solos every fortnight.

2019,An Autobiography: and Other Writings,"This classic study of the working life of a professional writer is one of the best - and also one of the strangest - autobiographies ever written. After a miserable childhood and misspent youth, Trollope turned his life around at the age of twenty-six. By 1860 the 'hobbledehoy' had become both a senior civil servant and a best-selling novelist. He worked for the Post Office for many years and stood unsuccessfully for Parliament. Best-known for the two series of novels grouped loosely around the clerical and political professions, the Barsetshire and Palliser series, in his Autobiography Trollope frankly describes his writing habits. His apparent preoccupation with contracts, deadlines, and earnings, and his account of the remorseless regularity with which he produced his daily quota of words, has divided opinion ever since. As the Introduction to this edition shows, Trollope selected and exaggerated to create his compelling narrative of initial failure and eventual success, and the inspiration that fuelled his creative imagination has too easily been overlooked. The only autobiography by a major Victorian novelist, Trollope's record offers a fascinating insight into his literary life and opinions. This edition also includes a selection of his critical writings to show how subtle and complex his approach to literature really was.",, ,368,Anthony Trollope,Nicholas Shrimpton, ,3.00,1,0,OUP Oxford,October 9th 2014,Kindle Edition,English,2817-24877591-an-autobiography.html

2028,Journey with Children: The Autobiography of a Teacher,"Filled with timeless, pertinent, and well-documented information, Journey with Children is a heartfelt, enthralling memoir of Frances Hawkins and her abiding dedication to the education of young children. A memoir and role model for professionals who care deeply about the children they work with, Hawkins emphasises the importance of putting on a different lens to view each child as an individual. Having been a teacher for more than five decades, her views on how the war, depression, and other societal issues that affect children's development and learning are insightful and thought-provoking. Most of the children Hawkins writes about are impoverished and troubled. A cornerstone of Hawkin's teaching ethic was moving her students toward a more hands-on, manipulative style. Her writing addresses all of the issues that confound people involved in education, including boredom, dropouts, and the inability to 'reach' many students.By interspersing comments on early childhood education teaching practice, theories in child growth and development, and material for child psychology, Hawkins enriches the reader's understanding and grasp of the concepts and broader importance of cultural and educational implications.",0870814516,9780870814518,360,Frances Pockman Hawkins, , ,5.00,3,0,University Press of Colorado,June 1st 1997,Paperback,English,2825-8281408-journey-with-children.html

2033,Losing My Virginity: The Autobiography,"""Oh, screw it, let's do it."" That's the philosophy that has allowed Richard Branson, in slightly more than twenty-five years, to spawn so many successful ventures. From the airline business (Virgin Atlantic Airways), to music (Virgin Records and V2), to cola (Virgin Cola), to retail (Virgin Megastores), and nearly a hundred others, ranging from financial services to bridal wear, Branson has a track record second to none. Losing My Virginity is the unusual, frequently outrageous autobiography of one of the great business geniuses of our time. When Richard Branson started his first business, he and his friends decided that ""since we're complete virgins at business, let's call it just that: Virgin."" Since then, Branson has written his own ""rules"" for success, creating a group of companies with a global presence, but no central headquarters, no management hierarchy, and minimal bureaucracy. Many of Richard Branson's companies--airlines, retailing, and cola are good examples--were started in the face of entrenched competition. The experts said, ""Don't do it."" But Branson found golden opportunities in markets in which customers have been ripped off or underserved, where confusion reigns, and the competition is complacent. And in this stressed-out, overworked age, Richard Branson gives us a new model: a dynamic, hardworking, successful entrepreneur who lives life to the fullest. Family, friends, fun, and adventure are equally important as business in Branson's life. Losing My Virginity is a portrait of a productive, sane, balanced life, filled with rich and colorful stories: Crash-landing his hot-air balloon in the Algerian desert, yet remaining determined to have another go at being the first to circle the globe Signing the Sex Pistols, Janet Jackson, the Rolling Stones, Boy George, and Phil Collins Fighting back when British Airways took on Virgin Atlantic and successfully suing this pillar of the British business establishment Swimming two miles to safety during a violent storm off the coast of Mexico Selling Virgin Records to save Virgin Atlantic Staging a rescue flight into Baghdad before the start of the Gulf War . . . And much more. Losing My Virginity is the ultimate tale of personal and business survival from a man who combines the business prowess of Bill Gates and the promotional instincts of P. T. Barnum. Also available in the UK from Virgin Publishing, and in Canada from General Publishing, From the Hardcover edition.",0307720748,9780307720740,592,Richard Branson, , ,4.07,13514,622,Crown Business,October 19th 1999,Paperback, ,283-9533705-losing-my-virginity.html

2035,Autobiography of Allen Jay,"Allen Jay was one of the most remarkable Friends of the nineteenth century, indeed, perhaps one of the most remarkable Friends who ever lived. His life was full of paradoxes. Born with a cleft palate, he became one of the most admired and successful Quaker preachers of his time. A native of the Ohio frontier, he became widely traveled and admired around the globe. A peacemaker by nature, he nevertheless did not shrink from controversy when he saw a principle involved. Firmly committed to what he understood as historic Quakerism, he nevertheless helped lead perhaps the most dramatic, even revolutionary, change that it has ever experienced. And in the midst of controversy, he managed to retain the respect, even love, of almost everyone with whom he came into contact. - From the Introduction, by Thomas D. Hamm If you want to understand Quakerism in the 1600s, you have to read The Journal of George Fox. If you want to understand Friends in the 1700s, you have to read The Journal of John Woolman.

Listening to the various scientific bodies located around our world, I contemplate their submissions of doom. The diversity of opinion seems, at times, contradictory, and yet as Earth reveals in her changing moods a threat to humanity's future, the majority of us continue to ignore her warning. There are two over-powering reasons that should influence us to pause and rethink the strategy to live our lives here. First is the transient aspect of it, second, our inevitable transition into the next world when it ends. 'Sixty Psychic Years' describes a life-time of psychic experiences I have witnessed both from seances, held by my mother; a practicing spiritual medium over that period, and many inexplicable events that have occurred throughout my life.",1452022844,9781452022840,0,Chris J.

2044,Twin Ambitions: My Autobiography,"4 August, 2012. Super Saturday. On the most electric night in the history of British sport, Mo Farah braved the pain and punishment to seize Olympic gold in the 10,000m - and in the process went from being a talented athlete to a national treasure. Seven days later, Mo seized his second gold at the 5000m to go where no British distance runner has gone before. Records have tumbled before him: European track records at 1500m, 5000m indoors, and 10,000m; British track records at 5000m, 3000m indoors and 10k on the road have all fallen to Mohamed 'Mo' Farah: the boy from Somalia who came to Britain at the age of eight, leaving behind his twin brother, and with just a few words of English, and a natural talent for running. His secondary school PE teacher Alan Watkinson spotted his potential and began easing this human gazelle towards the racetrack. In 2001 Mo showed his promise by winning the 5000m at the European Junior Championships. Soon he was smashing a string of British and European records. He began living with a group of elite Kenyan runners, following their strict regime of run, sleep, eat and rest. Mo was determined to leave no stone uncovered in his bid for distance-running glory. After a disappointing Olympics in Beijing Mo took the bold decision to relocate to Portland, Oregon to work under legendary coach Alberto Salazar. The results were emphatic as Mo took silver at the 10,000m and then raced to gold in the 5000m at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu. Even better would soon follow at London 2012. TWIN AMBITIONS is much more than an autobiography by a great Olympic champion. It's a moving human story of a man who grew up in difficult circumstances, separated from his family at an early age, who struggled to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles and realise his dream.",1444779575,9781444779578,384,Mo Farah, , ,4.03,166,20,Hodder & Stoughton,October 10th 2013,Hardcover,English,284-18691317-twin-ambitions.html

2049,Breaking Glass Barefoot: The Autobiography,"Hazel O’Connor has loved and been loved, but her generosity and spirit of adventure have often come back to bite her. She would not have it any other way. This is a story not just of the music business, its intense joys and spectacular lows: it is the story of a beautiful teenage runaway, a soldier’s daughter who fought her own battles and those of people she cared for. Born in Coventry to English-Irish parents, Hazel’s early years were a mixture of adventure and tragedy, which included performing in a dance troupe in Japan and Beirut (escaping after the first bombs fell during the war), as well as travels through Africa: A time of mixed blessings for the young Hazel who experienced both rape and abortion. By the mid seventies Hazel was back in England trying to find her way in an ever-changing musical environment, and before long was hanging out with the likes of Mick Jones of The Clash, and Glen Matlock from the Sex Pistols. As one decade segued into another Hazel was suddenly plucked from obscurity to not only star in the 1980 film ‘Breaking Glass’ but to also compose all the songs, including the hits “Eighth Day” and “Will You.” Achieving instant success prompted Hazel to say, ‘I was twenty-one and I felt like my whole life was behind me.’ But nothing could be further from the truth: Hazel’s career has been a roller coaster ride ever since that has included fascinating friendships, and relationships with The Stranglers’ Hugh Cornwell, and Ultravox’s Midge Ure. Her career as both a musician and actress through the past thirty years has also involved encounters with David Bowie, Tony Visconti, Duran Duran, Jesse Birdsall and Neil Morrissey amongst others. Hazel was even driven around Ireland during her early career by a young Louis Walsh; played Boggle with Bob Geldof and taught Elton John to balance a spoon on the end of his nose! The press even described her as George Michael’s girlfriend! After a failed marriage where she lived in Los Angeles, Hazel now divides her time between Ireland and France whilst still delighting audiences and touring extensively throughout Europe. Breaking Glass Barefoot, her first, full autobiography captures all the ups and downs of a life of adventure and trauma, sadness and celebrity; which speak to anyone who has ever followed their heart.",, ,244,Hazel O'Connor, , ,3.50,2,0,Wymer Publishing,October 8th 2012,Hardcover,English,2844-18524383-breaking-glass-barefoot.html

2054,Autobiography of Jack London,"Jack London has been a best-selling author for more than one hundred years. In his short life (1876–1916) he wrote twenty-five novels and dozens of short stories, plays, and essays. Today he is recognized as a forerunner of such literary giants as Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, and Jack Kerouac. Author of a number of well-known and well-loved stories in our literature (including White Fang, The Call of the Wild, and The Sea Wolf), London also worked as a day laborer, Alaskan gold rusher, and seaman. He was also an adventurer, journalist, celebrity, polemicist, and drunk.An Autobiography of Jack London is a revealing portrait of the man who was Jack London—in his own words—and is largely composed of excerpts from his memoirs: The Road, John Barleycorn, and The Cruise of the Snark. Rather than a mere biographical summary of a man’s life, An Autobiography of Jack London aims to give the reader real insight into the character and personality of this uniquely American literary icon.

2055,Bright Felon: Autobiography and Cities,"This groundbreaking, transgenre work--part detective story, part literary memoir, part imagined past--is intensely autobiographical and confessional. Proceeding sentence by sentence, city by city, and backwards in time, poet and essayist Kazim Ali details the struggle of coming of age between cultures, overcoming personal and family strictures to talk about private affairs and secrets long held. The text is comprised of sentences that alternate in time, ranging from discursive essay to memoir to prose poetry. Art, history, politics, geography, love, sexuality, writing, and religion, and the role silence plays in each, are its interwoven themes. Bright Felon is literally ""autobiography"" because the text itself becomes a form of writing the life, revealing secrets, and then, amid the shards and fragments of experience, dealing with the aftermath of such revelations. Bright Felon offers a new and active form of autobiography alongside such texts as Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's Dictee, Lyn Hejinian's My Life, and Etel Adnan's In the Heart of the Heart of Another Country.

2066,Autobiography of Madame Guyon,"Madame Guyon was a French noblewoman who was born in an unprincipled time fated to its corruption. She grew up in a church as licentious as the world in which it was established: spiritually despondent and plagued by ignorance. Regardless of these tormenting conditions, she rose to the inimitability of Christian veneration. She had an unsteady and disorganized childhood, was tormented by sickness and abuse, and was imprisoned for years by the highest church authorities. She gave up her worldly goods at the demands of this church which led to her impoverishment. She survived her psychological and physical ruination by conquering pretentious royal conspiracies and reviling the malignancy of the papal inquisition. She committed her life to writing meditative books that illustrated profound truths lost to religious monarchs in a maze of their own confusion. She was finally condemned as a heretic, but her writings were so dynamic they shocked the whole country and even reached the indecorous palace of King Louis XIV. This is the story of a solitary woman whose pious diligence and dedication laid the bedrock of virtous obedience to the deeds of contemporaneous ministry.",1595479260,9781595479266,212,Jeanne Marie Bouvier de la Motte Guyon, , ,4.12,119,15,Nuvision Publications,March 20th 2007,Paperback,English,286-1577133.Autobiography_of_Madame_Guyon.html

2071,Breaking Glass Barefoot: The Autobiography,"Hazel O’Connor has loved and been loved, but her generosity and spirit of adventure have often come back to bite her. She would not have it any other way. This is a story not just of the music business, its intense joys and spectacular lows: it is the story of a beautiful teenage runaway, a soldier’s daughter who fought her own battles and those of people she cared for. Born in Coventry to English-Irish parents, Hazel’s early years were a mixture of adventure and tragedy, which included performing in a dance troupe in Japan and Beirut (escaping after the first bombs fell during the war), as well as travels through Africa: A time of mixed blessings for the young Hazel who experienced both rape and abortion. By the mid seventies Hazel was back in England trying to find her way in an ever-changing musical environment, and before long was hanging out with the likes of Mick Jones of The Clash, and Glen Matlock from the Sex Pistols. As one decade segued into another Hazel was suddenly plucked from obscurity to not only star in the 1980 film ‘Breaking Glass’ but to also compose all the songs, including the hits “Eighth Day” and “Will You.” Achieving instant success prompted Hazel to say, ‘I was twenty-one and I felt like my whole life was behind me.’ But nothing could be further from the truth: Hazel’s career has been a roller coaster ride ever since that has included fascinating friendships, and relationships with The Stranglers’ Hugh Cornwell, and Ultravox’s Midge Ure. Her career as both a musician and actress through the past thirty years has also involved encounters with David Bowie, Tony Visconti, Duran Duran, Jesse Birdsall and Neil Morrissey amongst others. Hazel was even driven around Ireland during her early career by a young Louis Walsh; played Boggle with Bob Geldof and taught Elton John to balance a spoon on the end of his nose! The press even described her as George Michael’s girlfriend! After a failed marriage where she lived in Los Angeles, Hazel now divides her time between Ireland and France whilst still delighting audiences and touring extensively throughout Europe. Breaking Glass Barefoot, her first, full autobiography captures all the ups and downs of a life of adventure and trauma, sadness and celebrity; which speak to anyone who has ever followed their heart.",, ,244,Hazel O'Connor, , ,3.50,2,0,Wymer Publishing,October 8th 2012,Hardcover,English,2864-18524383-breaking-glass-barefoot.html

In his short life (1876–1916) he wrote twenty-five novels and dozens of short stories, plays, and essays.

Author of a number of well-known and well-loved stories in our literature (including White Fang, The Call of the Wild, and The Sea Wolf), London also worked as a day laborer, Alaskan gold rusher, and seaman. He was also an adventurer, journalist, celebrity, polemicist, and drunk.An Autobiography of Jack London is a revealing portrait of the man who was Jack London—in his own words—and is largely composed of excerpts from his memoirs: The Road, John Barleycorn, and The Cruise of the Snark. Rather than a mere biographical summary of a man’s life, An Autobiography of Jack London aims to give the reader real insight into the character and personality of this uniquely American literary icon.

We follow him from the beginnings of his thoughts to his crowning conclusion 'This particular brain ... has arrived at the establishment of the Socialist World-State as its directive purpose and has made that its religion and end.' On reading this remarkable account, President Roosevelt wrote to Wells to say: 'An Experiment in Autobiography was for me an experiment in staying awake instead of putting the light out.

2101,Hitting Back: The Autobiography,"' With Andy, the sky's the limit... ' - John McEnroe. At Wimbledon in 2005, a young, brash Andy Murray came out of nowhere and thrashed star pros Georges Bastl and Radek Stepanek. He took a two-set lead against former finalist David Nalbandian before his dramatic winning run came to a end on the Centre Court. But a legend was born, and Britain had a new sporting hero. Henman Hill was renamed Murray Mound, and Henmania became Andymonium. In 2006, Murray went stellar. Aged just 18 he won his first ATP title at San Jose, California, beating former world no. 1s Andy Roddick and Lleyton Hewitt on the way. In the same month, he deposed Tim Henman to become the British No. 1. By the end of a wonderful year in which he was one of only two players to beat Roger Federer, Murray was no. 17 in the world. But Murray is much more than a truly gifted tennis player and potential grand slam champion. He has changed the face of the British game, blowing away the cobwebs of the All England Club, and dividing opinion with his brash, straight-talking style, anti-establishment rhetoric and on-court anger and passion. A whole new generation of kids are becoming tennis fans. Andy has made tennis cool again, like the days of McEnroe, Borg and Nastase. Here, for the first time, Andy Murray talks in his own words about the long, testing, and often difficult path to superstardom. The boy from Dunblane opens up about dealing with the constant limelight and attention from a media and a general public desperate for a genuine British tennis star, and gives the exclusive lowdown on Wimbledon 2008 as he prepares to launch his bid for grass-court glory. Temperamental, gifted, passionate, fiery: Murray is the dazzling new face of British tennis, and a role model to a whole generation. Andy's story will enthral and excite the entire country.",, ,330,Andy Murray, , ,3.67,3,0,Cornerstone Digital,May 4th 2009,Kindle Edition,English,2891-20341654-hitting-back.html
2102,Lucifer: Autobiography of a Prince ... and Stuff,"Lucifer tells of himself as has not been told before. He tells how he came to be that which he is; the how and why, while attempting to set the record straight in regard to what he does... and cannot do. Emphatically he states that he gets blamed - ""The Devil made me do it!"" - when in fact, he was nowhere near. He presents his tale in a comical and somewhat rebellious fashion, using some four-letter words...""As they fit,"" he states. ""And besides, I learned them from you."" His story is not a satanical, evil, religion, mystery or a whodunit. It is of a being that has been made out to be what he is not, so he feels, and blamed for humanity's shortcomings to the point where he has had enough and wants to make sure we get the true picture. He includes Michael, the Archangel, teaching him and Jesus how to line-dance. Beyond telling of himself, he goes into telling of his son's quest to live among humans; the trials and tribulations of a young boy, half-Satan and half-mortal, to exist on the face of the Earth. In the end, the son causes the death of a human and is dealt with by god...his grandfather. Later, Lucifer will again take pen in hand and continue to tell of his only begotten - Uriah.",1412098394,9781412098397,372,Lucifer, , ,0.00,0,0,Trafford Publishing,October 26th 2006,Paperback,English,2892-8231116-lucifer.html

2105,Straight Left: An Autobiography,"An insider's view of political events in Northern Ireland in the 1970s, the autobiography of the Belfast socialist and founder-member of the Social Democrat and Labour Party. Devlin was one of the most fearless and colorful characters ever to grace the Northern Ireland political stage; his book should be essential reading for students of modern Irish history. Devlin grew up in poverty - stricken Belfast in the '20s and '30s. He was born into a highly politicized family, his mother a nationalist, his father a socialist. He soon found himself interned for IRA membership, an experience that radically transformed his life. Turning his back on violence, he became one of Belfast's most committed and hard-working union activists. During the maelstrom of the Troubles he was at the center of many key events that shaped Northern Ireland's destiny.",0856405140,9780856405143,0,Paddy Devlin, , ,4.00,2,1,Blackstaff Press,June 28th 2000,Paperback,English,2895-1445524.Straight_Left.html
2106,Rhinestone Cowboy An Autobiography,"With extraordinary candor intended to set the record straight, one of music's most popular performers tells of his sojourn amid the decadence and destructive trappings of fame - the bucks, the booze, the cocaine, the women - and of the religious awakening and unconditionally loving marriage that literally saved his life. Glen Campbell's boy-next-door persona belied his hedonistic, near-fatal lifestyle. It all started like a dream - the rise from ruthless poverty as one of twelve children in a small Arkansas town and the against-all struggle for stardom, first as a brilliant studio musician (behind artists such as Sinatra, Elvis, Ray Charles, and Nat King Cole), then as a solo performer who in the sixties and seventies sold some 45 million records (including the timeless classics ""Wichita Lineman,"" ""Gentle on My Mind,"" ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix,"" and, of course, ""Rhinestone Cowboy"") and hosted his own top-rated TV show. Too quickly, though, the dream became a nightmare of mad spending, multiple marriages, and abusive and all-too-public affairs, as well as wildly escalating alcohol and cocaine dependencies that threatened not only his career but his very existence. Now a Christian and in recovery, he has stepped back into the spotlight a whole man at last. With the help of bestselling author Tom Carter, Glen Campbell has given us a book that is both a star-studded show-biz memoir and a spiritual testimony that radiates great faith and emotion. Rhinestone Cowboy is his personal gift of thanks to the millions who have supported him through decades of good times and bad - and to the vast new audience who have grown to know him through his frequent appearances on cable television's 700 Club and other Christian TV shows. ""A lot of people are going to be surprised by my story, and I hope that a lot are going to be inspired,"" Campbell declares. ""All I know for sure is that it's time to tell it. And as honestly as I can, that's just what I've gone and done.""",0849911761,9780849911767,0,Glen Campbell,Tom Carter, ,3.00,1,0,W Publishing Group,June 1st 1994,Library Binding,English,2896-7437137-rhinestone-cowboy-an-autobiography.html

Dismissal of the band--Count Durazzo--My journey to Italy with Gluck -- Marini -- Sojourn in Venice and Bologna--Farinelli--Nicolini and the blind beggar-- A deputation--Father Martin--Panic--Hurried return to Vienna--Lolli and I are rivals. The Prince, my patron, was great-uncle of the reigning Duke of Sachsen Hildburghausen, who died about this time, --the hereditary successor to the Dukedom being a child between six and seven years of age. The result was, that not only the guardianship of the ward devolved upon the Prince, but the administration and government of the Duchy as well. He willingly undertook both offices, and moved to Hildburghausen accordingly. As he found an orchestra ready made at this Court, and as he had his hands full with the education of the hereditary Prince and the administration of the estate, he felt obliged to dismiss the greater part of his own band. To prevent their losing a livelihood, he agreed with Count Durazzo, then the chief director of the Court Theatre, that we should be taken on by him. The contract bound us for three years' service, during which we were obliged to play in the Opera House and at Court, for the same pay that we had received in the Prince's service. No one suffered more than I did by this arrangement, for I had to play almost daily from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at operatic and ballet rehearsals, not to mention theatrical performances from 6.30 to 10.30 of an evening, as well as accompanying at the theatrical concerts, and playing solos every fortnight.

2127,An Autobiography: and Other Writings,"This classic study of the working life of a professional writer is one of the best - and also one of the strangest - autobiographies ever written. After a miserable childhood and misspent youth, Trollope turned his life around at the age of twenty-six. By 1860 the 'hobbledehoy' had become both a senior civil servant and a best-selling novelist. He worked for the Post Office for many years and stood unsuccessfully for Parliament. Best-known for the two series of novels grouped loosely around the clerical and political professions, the Barsetshire and Palliser series, in his Autobiography Trollope frankly describes his writing habits. His apparent preoccupation with contracts, deadlines, and earnings, and his account of the remorseless regularity with which he produced his daily quota of words, has divided opinion ever since. As the Introduction to this edition shows, Trollope selected and exaggerated to create his compelling narrative of initial failure and eventual success, and the inspiration that fuelled his creative imagination has too easily been overlooked. The only autobiography by a major Victorian novelist, Trollope's record offers a fascinating insight into his literary life and opinions. This edition also includes a selection of his critical writings to show how subtle and complex his approach to literature really was.",, ,368,Anthony Trollope,Nicholas Shrimpton, ,3.00,1,0,OUP Oxford,October 9th 2014,Kindle Edition,English,2915-24877591-an-autobiography.html

2132,Dreaming in Color: An Autobiography,"Kaffe Fassett has led an extraordinary life and is a captivating storyteller with a vivid memory. Born in 1937, he spent much of his youth in Big Sur, California, where his parents bought a cabin from Orson Welles and transformed it into the world-famous Nepenthe restaurant, a gathering place for artists and bohemians. After attending a boarding school run by the disciples of Krishnamurti, an Indian guru, he studied painting at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, then traveled to England, where he made his home. After an inspiring trip to Inverness, Scotland, Fassett began designing knitwear for Bill Gibb, and then the Missonis, Vogue magazine, and private clients like Lauren Bacall and Barbra Streisand, and, in the process, revolutionized the handknitting world with his explosive use of color. Further explorations led him to needlepoint, mosaics, rugmaking, tapestries, yarn and fabric design, costume and set design, and quilting. Now in his seventies, Fassett continues to produce new work and to travel worldwide to teach and lecture. In this intimate autobiography, Fassett shares rich, detailed stories about his lifelong creative journey as well as hundreds of glorious photos taken along the way. Praise for Kaffe Fassett: Dreaming in Color: “Kaffe Fassett is to color what Julia Child was to French cooking.” — Knitters Review “Lavishly illustrated with photographs from his life and work and dishing on everyone from Dustin Hoffman to Princess Margaret, Dreaming in Color describes a charmed life filled with creativity, big personalities, travels and not a little serendipity.” — Vogue Knitting “Shapes and patterns are everywhere; they lie waiting for the person who wants to see them. It's the bricolage aspect behind his work and, arguably, Fassett himself: arranging disparate things to create something dynamic and new.” — Vogue Knitting “This book would be a beautiful gift to receive or give. It is like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.” —Examiner.com “A glance through his new autobiography shows that this is a man who, in design terms, hit the ground running and has never stopped.” —Selvedge magazine “Dreaming in Color , lavishly illustrated with 500 color pictures, is a feast for the eyes.” — Shelf Awareness “Reading this book is like peeling an orange on a gray winter’s day—every single one of your senses is sparked as you get sprayed with infectious creativity.” —Knitty.com “Kaffe Fassett is a luminary in the world of textiles and knitting, spreading the gospel of color in his books and travels.” — The Houston Chronicle “It is a beautiful book, no question. Beautifully designed, thoughtfully composed, well-written, Kaffe takes you on his creative journey. We all—quilters, knitters, needlepointers, and just plain art lovers—are indeed very fortunate that he would share all of this with the world.” — Getting Stitched on the Farm “Fassett is a kind of Harrison Ford of the knitting world….” — The Washington Post “Kaffe Fassett is a luminary in the world of textiles and knitting, spreading the gospel of color in his books and travels.”— The Houston Chronicle “This book is a gorgeous coffee table treasure but it so much more than the vibrant photos, it is a moving and interesting autobiography and I am so glad it has been published. What a treat to read, hold, soak in and enjoy.” —Susan B. Anderson “Brimming over with beautiful eye-candy and intimate details, this colorful book is sure to charm and inspire.” — Love of Knitting magazine “One of the book’s many virtues is how effectively Fassett conveys his enthusiasm about his work to the reader. ‘I’m st",158479996X,9781584799962,224,Kaffe Fassett, , ,4.22,125,28,Stewar,September 15th 2012,Hardcover,English,292-13591163-dreaming-in-color.html

2137,Bird Student: An Autobiography,"At thirteen, George Miksch Sutton planned a school of ornithology centered around his collection of bird skins, feathers, bones, nests, eggs, and a prized stuffed crow. As an adult, he became one of the most prominent ornithologists and bird artists of the twentieth century. He describes his metamorphosis from amateur to professional in Bird Student. Born in 1898, Sutton gives us his clearest memories of his boyhood in Nebraska, Minnesota, Oregon, Illinois, Texas, and West Virginia with his closely knit family. Recognizing birds, identifying them correctly, drawing them, and writing about them became more and more important to him. His intense admiration for Louis Agassiz Fuertes had a good deal to do with his beginning to draw birds in earnest, and his correspondence and his 1916 summer visit with the generous Fuertes taught him to look at birds with the eyes of a professional artist and to consider the possibility of making ornithology his career. By 1918, Sutton had talked himself into a job at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, which gave him fresh opportunities to learn and travel, and his 1920 field trip to the Labrador Peninsula stimulated his lifelong interest in arctic birds. Further expeditions to James Bay, the east coast of Hudson Bay-on leave from his job as state ornithologist of Pennsylvania-and Southampton Island at the north end of Hudson Bay, in search of the elusive blue goose and its nesting grounds, give us glimpses of field methods before the days of sophisticated equipment. Sutton ends his autobiography in 1935, with an account of his graduate days at Cornell University and his position as curator of the Fuertes Memorial Collection of Birds. Bird Student is about raising young roadrunners and owls and prairie dogs, sailing (and being stranded) in arctic waters, preparing specimens in the hold of a ship, hunting birds and caribou and bears in almost inaccessible regions, canoeing in the Far North, camping in Florida, and delivering speeches in Pennsylvania. Sutton's gift for mixing facts and philosophy lets us see the evolution of a naturalist, as his inherent curiosity and innocent enjoyment of beauty led to a permanent desire to preserve this beauty.",0292707274,9780292707276,216,George Miksch Sutton, , ,4.00,2,0,University of Texas Press,January 1st 1980,Hardcover,English,2924-3028071-bird-student.html

G. Wells in Love, which Wells drafted as 'Postscript to an Experiment in Autobiography' and can be read as an accompaniment to these volumes). In these volumes, Wells relates his early life, student days, struggles to make a living, ascent to literary supremacy, and later career as prophet of socialism. We follow him from the beginnings of his thoughts to his crowning conclusion 'This particular brain ... has arrived at the establishment of the Socialist World-State as its directive purpose and has made that its religion and end.' On reading this remarkable account, President Roosevelt wrote to Wells to say: 'An Experiment in Autobiography was for me an experiment in staying awake instead of putting the light out.

2168,Anthony Daly Autobiography,"Anthony Daly was the most successful captain in the history of Clare hurling, leading the county to two All-Irelands and three Munster titles. First appointed Clare captain at just 23, he retained the role for eight seasons. Regarded as an absolutely inspirational figure by his fellow players, the captaincy was a natural extension of his personality. It was that innate leadership and character which prompted the players, just three years after he had finished playing with Clare, to pursue Daly as manager. When he took over in the autumn of 2003, Daly was just 34, and was one of the youngest hurling inter-county managers ever appointed. During his three years in charge, he took Clare to the cusp of two All-Ireland finals, agonizingly losing the 2005 and 2006 All-Ireland semi-finals to the eventual winners, Cork and Kilkenny. It was that kind of ambition and drive to succeed which attracted Dublin to Daly. Since taking over the county in 2009, he has led Dublin to their first National League title in 72 years and their first Leinster title in 52 years. This book takes us from the early days growing up in Clarecastle through the graveyard years of the early part of his career with Clare, through to the golden years and the extension into management. Interlaced with drama, tragedy, his love of other sports, and his immense wit, Anthony Daly’s autobiography offers a compelling insight into an absolutely unique personality in modern Irish sport.",1848271514,9781848271517,320,Anthony Daly, , ,3.00,3,0,Transworld Publishers,January 1st 2015,Paperback, ,2952-21450186-anthony-daly-autobiography.html

Across six decades, Sir Tom Jones has maintained a vital career in a risky, unstable business notorious for the short lives of its artists. With a drive that comes from nothing but the love for what he does, he breaks through and then wrestles with the vagaries of the music industry, the nature of success and its inevitable consequences. Having recorded an expansive body of work and performed with fellow artists from across the spectrum and across every popular music genre, from rock, pop and dance to country, blues and soul, the one constant throughout has been his unique musical gifts and unmistakable voice. But how did a boy from a Welsh coal-mining family attain success across the globe? And how has he survived the twists and turns of fame and fortune to not only stay exciting, but actually become more credible and interesting with age? In this, his first and only autobiography, Tom revisits his past and tells the tale of his journey from wartime Pontypridd to LA and beyond. He reveals the stories behind the ups and downs of his fascinating and remarkable life, from the early heydays to the subsequent fallow years to his later period of artistic renaissance.

2176,Douglass: The Lost Autobiography (The Biographizer Trilogy #3),"Frederick Douglass stands as one of American history’s most extraordinary figures, overcoming the evils of slavery and racial construction by force of will and grit. As a fervent abolitionist, gifted orator, and sagacious editor and author, he became one of the most outspoken and influential social reformers of his time. During his life, he published three autobiographies chronicling his struggle from childhood to adulthood, from slave to free man, from ignorance to power-knowledge. And yet the full narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass, contrary to popular belief, has been incomplete ... until now. Recently recovered on an archeological dig in Ireland, where Douglass lectured extensively in the 1840s, this heretofore “lost” autobiography marks the fourth and final work in the library of his selfhood. Tying together loose ends in the previous three autobiographies while exposing remarkable, often disturbing secrets about his private life, Douglass portrays himself not only as a man of words and character but as a kind of anachronistic hipster and proto-beatnik. There is a reason this volume never saw publication during his lifetime. A reason—and a method. “Once again, D. Harlan Wilson biographizes with a hammer. Beware.” —William Clarke Quantrill, Professor of Religious Studies and Director of the Booker T.

2187,Moab Is My Washpot: An Autobiography (Memoir #1),"A number one bestseller in Britain that topped the lists there for months, Stephen Fry's astonishingly frank, funny, wise memoir is the book that his fans everywhere have been waiting for. Since his PBS television debut in the Blackadder series, the American profile of this multitalented writer, actor and comedian has grown steadily, especially in the wake of his title role in the film Wilde, which earned him a Golden Globe nomination, and his supporting role in A Civil Action. Fry has already given readers a taste of his tumultuous adolescence in his autobiographical first novel, The Liar , and now he reveals the equally tumultuous life that inspired it. Sent to boarding school at the age of seven, he survived beatings, misery, love affairs, carnal violation, expulsion, attempted suicide, criminal conviction and imprisonment to emerge, at the age of eighteen, ready to start over in a world in which he had always felt a stranger. One of very few Cambridge University graduates to have been imprisoned prior to his freshman year, Fry is a brilliantly idiosyncratic character who continues to attract controversy, empathy and real devotion. This extraordinary and affecting book has ""a tragic grandeur that lifts it to classic status,"" raved the Financial Times in one of the many ecstatic British reviews. Stephen Fry's autobiography, in turns funny, shocking, sad, bruisingly frank and always compulsively readable, could well become a classic gay coming-of-age memoir.",0375502645,9780375502644,366,Stephen Fry, , ,4.01,13639,714,Random House,May 25th 1999,Hardcover, ,297-492929.Moab_Is_My_Washpot.html

He was an unmistakable figure on the oche during his 1980s heyday, and became renowned not just for the number of world titles he won but for his arrogance on stage and off it. In this candid account Bristow reveals how darts proved a salvation from his early life as a cat burglar, shoplifter and thug, introducing him to a new world of beer, babes and undreamed of success. And in his rapid rise to the top he gives fascinating insights into the characters that pioneered darts in those early days and how, when his own career began to slide at the end of the decade, he trained his protégé Phil 'The Power' Taylor, turning him into the most successful player darts has ever known. Bristow holds nothing back as he reveals his battle with dartitis, a psychological condition which left him unable to let go of the dart and almost destroyed his career; his relationship with girlfriend and former women's world darts champion Maureen Flowers; and his occasional all-too-public falls from grace. Bristow's life story is a thrill-a-minute ride through the raucous world of darts and how it has helped to shape and drive his life over the past forty years.",, ,370,Eric Bristow, , ,3.40,5,1,Cornerstone Digital,September 15th 2009,Kindle Edition,English,2970-19396515-eric-bristow.html

2195,Fabricating Lives: Explorations in American Autobiography,"How does the autobiographer want us to perceive him? How do we penetrate the memoirist’s strategies and subterfuges—sometimes conscious, usually—brilliant—and discover the real person screened behind them? In this fresh and provocative approach to the reading of autobiography, Herbert Leibowitz explores the self-portraits of eight Americans whose lives span almost two centuries and encompass a stunning range of personality and circumstances: Benjamin Franklin, Louis Sullivan, Jane Addams, Emma Goldman, Gertrude Stein, William Carlos Williams, Richard Wright, and Edward Dahlberg. In pursuit of clues to both the human essence and the literary artifice of each, he examines their styles (Franklin’s plain talk and “possum’s wit,” Sullivan’s “gilded abstractions,” Stein’s “gossipy ventriloquism,” Williams’s “grumpy clowning” and foxy innocence), their metaphors, and their choices of incident, looking beyond their visions of themselves to their true identities. In American autobiography particularly Leibowitz finds an extraordinary medley of voices—from the balanced objectivity of Addams and the heated oratory of Goldman, as each encounters the promises and failures of the democratic ideal, to the uneasy self-consciousness of Wright, reflecting the tensions of growing up in a world he did not trust, and the baroque contrivances of Dahlberg, who painted himself in mythic proportions on the American canvas. As he guides us through the labyrinths and mazes of these self-histories, Leibowitz relates the material to a wide cross section of the American experience and helps to interpret our history. His engrossing and highly original book is both a contribution to biographical criticism and a vivid recapturing of some remarkable American lives.",0394574281,9780394574288,386,Herbert Leibowitz, , ,0.00,0,1,Knopf,September 9th 1989,Hardcover,English,2977-5712764-fabricating-lives.html

2207,Alan Bristow: Helicopter Pioneer: The Autobiography,"Alan Bristow, founder of Bristow Helicopters, died on April 26, 2009, seven days after completing his autobiography. He was a truly remarkable man; his full-page obituary was published in The Times and The Daily Telegraph. As a merchant navy officer cadet during the war Bristow survived two sinkings, played a part in the evacuation of Rangoon and was credited with shooting down two Stukas in North Africa. He joined the Fleet Air Arm and trained as one of the first British helicopter pilots, he was the first man to land a helicopter on a battleship and became Westland’s first helicopter test pilot. Sacked for knocking out the sales manager, he flew in France, Holland, Algeria, Senegal and elsewhere, narrowly escaping many helicopter crashes before winning the Croix de Guerre evacuating wounded French soldiers in Indochina. For four years he flew for Aristotle Onassis’s pirate whaling fleet in Antarctica before joining Douglas Bader and providing support services to oil drillers in the Persian Gulf. Out of that grew Bristow Helicopters Ltd, the largest helicopter company in the world outside America. Bristow’s circle included the great helicopter pioneers such as Igor Sikorsky and Stan Hiller, test pilots like Harold Penrose and Bill Waterton, Sheiks and Shahs and political leaders, business giants like Lord Cayzer and Freddie Laker – with whom he tossed a coin for £67,000 in 1969 – and the author James Clavell, a lifelong friend whose book 'Whirlwind' was a fictionalized account of Bristow’s overnight evacuation of his people and helicopters from revolutionary Iran. Bristow represented Great Britain at four in hand carriage driving with the Duke of Edinburgh and precipitated the ‘Westland Affair’ when he made a takeover bid which eventually led to the resignation of Michael Heseltine and Leon Brittain, and almost to the downfall of Margaret Thatcher.",, ,384,Patrick Malone,Alan Bristow, ,4.33,3,0,Pen & Sword,September 20th 2012,Kindle Edition,English,2988-19168161-alan-bristow.html

Yet as one of the world's most recognised, and respected, spiritual leaders there will clearly be great interest in such a work from His Holiness' thousands of friends and followers around the world. The Dalai Lama sees himself first and foremost as a human being, secondly as a monk and thirdly as the political leader of Tibet. In this extraordinary book we read many hitherto unknown stories from his childhood, his formation as a monk and his gradual development as a leader of his people. We are offered a view of his daily spiritual practise, invited to listen in on the dialogue he has been pursuing with other religions, with non-believers and with scientists in his search for ethical and environmental principles, and shown how he brings a sense of goodness and conscience to political life around the globe. In a world that is so profoundly interdependent, the Dalai Lama explains how he transforms himself through spiritual means in order to have a positive effect on the world, and he encourages us to do the same by working on ourselves first of all.",1846042410,9781846042416,304,Dalai Lama XIV, , ,3.76,119,18,Rider,October 7th 2010,Hardcover,English,299-11812878-my-spiritual-autobiography.html

In the context of first-person narration, she shows how the philosophers in question turn their attention inward and unleash their analytical rigor on themselves. Wright argues that philosophical autobiography makes philosophical analysis necessary and that one cannot unfold without the other. Her distinction between the ontological and rhetorical dimensions of the self creates a rich middle ground in which questions of essence and identity bear upon existence.""",079146914X,9780791469149,217,J.

2211,Imagine No Religion: The Autobiography of Blase Bonpane,"This is the personal story of the life of Blase Bonpane, a vanguard practitioner of liberation theology and a former Maryknoll priest. In the wake of the Second Vatican Council 1962-1965 many religious people, especially those serving in Latin America, began to understand a spirituality that transcended sectarianism. Having come from an upwardly mobile Italian American family marked by Southern Italian anti-clericalism, Blase was accustomed to hearing his parents express real differences with their institutional church. He went into the seminary despite the avid protests of his parents. Blase's odyssey takes us from his high school and college years, through his service in Guatemala during a violent revolution, to his expulsion from that country for ""subversion."" After receiving gag order from the Church, which he could not in good conscience accept, Blase met with the editorial board of the Washington Post and released all of the material he had regarding the U.S. military presence in Guatemala. This action led to his separation from the Maryknoll Fathers. Blase accepted a teaching post at UCLA. While serving in academia, he met the former Maryknoll Sister Theresa Killeen, who had served in Southern Chile. They married in 1970. Their adventures include working directly with Cesar Chavez at his headquarters in La Paz, California, building solidarity with the Central American Revolution, forming the Office of the Americas, working in the forefront of the international movement for justice and peace, and raising two children. Blase worked on the ground for international peace in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Japan and Iraq. He led the U.S. contingent of the International March for Peace in Central America from Panama to Mexico in 1985-1986.",1597095532,9781597095532,240,Blase Bonpane, , ,5.00,2,0,Red Hen Press,October 1st 2011,Paperback,English,2991-13212082-imagine-no-religion.html
2212,Hard Case - The Autobiography of Jimmy Case,"Jimmy Case is best remembered for a spectacular FA Cup final goal and a deserved reputation as one of football’s genuine hard men. But that does scant justice to a career that covered more than 700 appearances for 7 league clubs and did not end until he retired, through injury, at the age of 41. Raised on Merseyside, Jimmy began at his beloved Liverpool, becoming a key player in the all-conquering team of the late 1970s alongside stars like Kevin Keegan, John Toshack, Ray Clemence, Phil Thompson, Kenny Dalglish and his two great mates, Tommy Smith and Ray Kennedy. At Anfield, where he was signed by Bill Shankly and guided by Bob Paisley, Jimmy won a boxful of medals: four league titles, three European cups plus a host of other domestic honours which tell the truth about Jimmy Case – that he had much more than a tough tackle and a ferocious shot. As Jimmy himself says, you couldn’t get in that Liverpool team if you couldn’t play. His ambition was to play his entire career at Liverpool but fate sent him on a different route: to Brighton, where he almost won the FA Cup; to Southampton, where he played more than 200 games; to Bournemouth; Halifax; Wrexham; and a single outing for Darlington. Along the way he came up against players like Andy Gray, Graeme Souness, David Speedie, Graeme Sharp and Norman Whiteside, often with painful results. Packed with incident and anecdotes, usually funny – but occasionally sad – this is the story of Jimmy Case, a true football legend. ‘JIMMY’S A FUNNY GUY, FULL OF ANECDOTES AND MEMORIES, AND HIS BOOK TELLS YOU HOW HE WENT FROM BEING A NON-LEAGUE SCOUSER TO A EUROPEAN CHAMPION’ – Tommy Smith ‘HE IS JUST THE PERSON YOU WOULD WANT WITH YOU IN THE TRENCHES IN A WAR…YOU’D LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT AND SEE JIMMY CASE.’ – Kevin Keegan ‘I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER HOW MUCH JIMMY DID FOR ME. HE WAS THERE WHEN I NEEDED HIM, HE PUT ME ON THE RIGHT TRACKS.’ – Alan Shearer ‘NOT MANY FOOTBALLERS CAN BOAST A CAREER AS LONG AND SUCCESSFUL AS JIMMY CASE. HIS BOOK TELLS YOU EXACTLY HOW HE DID IT’ – Harry Redknapp",, ,288,Jimmy Case,Kevin Keegan,Andrew Smart,3.67,3,0,John Blake,October 2nd 2014,Kindle Edition,English,2992-23785824-hard-case---the-autobiography-of-jimmy-case.html

2214,Off the Cuff: The Lee Briers Autobiography,"People often make assumptions about players from stories they hear. Lee Briers has had many things written and said about his life, good and bad, both on and off the field since he made his debut for Saints in 1997. Here, in his own words, he charts his meteoric rise from mayhem causing kid on the streets of St Helens to being rugby league's maverick superstar, lifting the Challenge Cup and winning the Lance Todd Trophy at Wembley. He talks about his debut with his boyhood club and how he was overlooked in the 1997 Cup Final, his move to Warrington, why he wasn't selected for Great Britain, and the phenomenal charge of the Wolves. And he describes the nights out, the beers and partying and how he cleaned up his act to become the consummate professional with irrepressible skills that have kept him at the top of his sport for over a decade. Lee also explains why he talks to referees, details many of his japes - including his naked singing in the dressing room - and puts forward his opinions on how the game should develop. There's affection too as he remembers the people that have helped him along the way, particularly his family and the coaches and players that have stood by him and the impact of his brother's untimely death. Off the Cuff is a no holds barred inside story of a true sporting great.",1904091784,9781904091783,240,Lee Briers,Mike Appleton, ,3.50,4,0,Vertical Editions,November 2nd 2013,Hardcover,English,2994-19920926-off-the-cuff.html

2217,The Invading Body: Reading Illness Autobiographies,"Widely debated in feminist, poststructuralist, and literary theory is the relationship between subjectivity and the body. Yet autobiographical criticism--an obvious place for testing this conceptual relationship--has lagged behind contemporary queries about the embodied self. In The Invading Body, Einat Avrahami corrects this deficiency by analyzing the genre of terminal illness autobiographies. These personal narratives challenge the world of self-writing in their power to question the assumption that autobiography--and the body--are products of cultural constructs and discursive practices. Their self-disclosures of symptoms, disabilities, and the physical and psychological pains of treatment, especially when combined with thoughts of further deterioration and imminent death, defy the theoretical formulations of identity and alter the definition of autobiography itself. Avrahami investigates an array of autobiographical testimonies of terminal illness ranging from Harold Brodkey's poignant account of his struggle with AIDS to Hannah Wilke's and Jo Spence's gripping self-portraits of cancer. By challenging the artificial and contrived skepticism that critics and theorists bring to their concepts of the self, the author argues, these illness narratives constitute an ""invasion of the real,"" confronting the notions of self-representation and self-invention on which current autobiographical studies are based. The author's examinations of these moving memoirs and photographs will engage not only the growing field of disability studies, but also a more general readership interested in the transition that occurs when one's body suddenly falls out of step with one's mind.",0813926645,9780813926643,224,Einat Avrahami, , ,4.00,1,0,University of Virginia Press,November 1st 2007,Hardcover,English,2997-7015615-the-invading-body.html
2218,A Cellarful of Noise: The Autobiography of the Man Who Made the Beatles,"From his first encounter with the sturggling group in 1961, through their meteoric rise, to his tragic, untimely death in 1967, Brian Epstein was in many ways the heart and soul of the Beatles.

2220,Rockers and Rollers: An Automotive Autobiography,"By night, Brian Johnson sings in the biggest rock 'n' roll band on the planet. But by day, AC/DC's frontman drives balls to the wall. Cars and rock 'n' roll--they were made for each other. When he was a young boy growing up in a working-class English town, Brian developed what would become a lifelong passion for cars, trolling junkyards and even pretending to drive the family car. From there, he steamed up the windows of his old Mini Cooper as a teenager, spent untold time in hygienically challenged tour buses with helpful signs such as ""No Shitting Allowed."" ""Shagging Expected,"" was chauffeured in leather-trimmed limos, and raced cars to a checkered flag. Featuring guest stars Cliff Williams, Malcolm and Angus Young, and many, many others, even Arnold Schwarzenegger, ""Rockers and Rollers"" is a tribute to Brian's obsession with four wheels.

2225,The Complete Speeches of Mark Twain/The Burlesque Autobiography,"ANNOTATED: * Contains literary critiques, detailed biographies, and historical context OVERVIEW: In addition to writing articles and books, Mark Twain delighted audiences with his public lectures about the far-flung locations he visited on his travels. Twain travelled around the world and he dazzled audiences far and wide with lectures filled with the same humor and spirit found in his writings. People were eager to learn about his trips to then-exotic places, such as the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii), Egypt and the Holy Land. Twain often used the fees he earned with his lectures to pay for additional adventures. His well-attended performances also served to bring attention to his published work. At a time when the public lecture was a very popular form of entertainment, and audiences' expectations ran high, Twain never failed to amuse. He was not only a writer’s writer, but also an actor’s actor ... who worked with the best written material any actor could wish for. This collection brings together, for the very first time in a single volume, the complete collected speeches of Mark Twain along with his famous ‘burlesque’ autobiography. The enduring freshness and relevance of Mark Twain’s works serves as a true testament to a remarkable spirit which “still young ... continues to cheer and comfort a tired world” even to this day. FROM THE PREFACE: Mark Twain's appearance on the stage of the world was a succession of dramatic moments. He was always exactly in the setting. Whatever he did, or whatever came to him, was timed for the instant of greatest effect. At the end he was more widely observed and loved and honored than ever before, and at the right moment and in the right manner he died. He travelled always such a broad and brilliant highway, with plumes flying and crowds following after. In the long analysis of the ages it is the truth that counts, and he never approximated, never compromised, but pronounced those absolute verities to which every human being of whatever rank must instantly respond. His understanding of subjective human nature—the vast, unwritten life within—was simply amazing. Such knowledge he acquired at the fountainhead—that is, from himself. He recognized in himself an extreme example of the human being with all the attributes of power and of weakness, and he made his exposition complete. CONTENTS: This new signature edition collection brings together for the very first time in a single volume the speeches of Mark Twain and his ‘burlesque’ autobiography, which was first published 1871. It contains an original preface as well as an in-depth and illuminating introduction by William Dean Howells of the American Academy of Arts and Letter. This illustrated volume also contains rare illustrations and photographs.

We set out the next day, with an immense escort, and were followed by large crowds of people from Jellalob and the neighbouring cities. Buffaloes, richly caparisoned, were provided for us, and for most of the accompanying dignitaries; but we preferred our horses; and, in compliment to us, the dagash and several high officers from the Court also took their seats in the saddle. On either side of us were footmen, who supported over our heads, by long slender poles, awnings of pure linen. These were bedecked with streamers of variously-coloured muslin, and with wreaths of fresh flowers. A little in the rear came a hand-barrow, in which were conspicuously placed our muskets and pistols. These seemed to attract the largest share of public attention, and the barrow was frequently raised aloft to afford the people an opportunity of seeing the wonderful machines, which, in the hands of the Footas, were beginning to threaten their existence as a nation. We passed several of the columns that I have mentioned, surmounted with the usual cube of lava. A very lofty one having attracted my attention, Seywad dal Gouk, one of the lords of the Court, who rode by my side, volunteered an explanation.

2233,Brown Bread Fred: The Autobiography of the Godfather of British Crime,"To Britain's underworld, Freddie Foreman is the Godfather. Responsible for the gangland killings of Ginger Marks and Frank 'The Mad Axeman' Mitchell, he was the punisher to those who broke the underworld's strict code of conduct. Foreman's dramatic kidnap and arrest for Britain's biggest cash robbery made headlines around the world, yet this daring raid was just the peak of a safe-blowing, bank-robbing career that had spanned decades. His story is a fascinating, yet chilling account of life as a freelance enforcer for the Kray twins, and as London's most feared gangster. But bloodshed aside, Freddie's often humourous stories reveal a caring man, one who treated even tied-up security guards with reverence. Giving one cigarettes as he emptied a safe, Freddie believed violence was always a last resort and treated people with respect. Revealed in these pages are the amazing details of the heists, the double crossings, the shoot-outs and the betrayals that accompanied life as a career criminal when the streets were controlled by fear. Exposed are the audacious plans behind the century's most famous crimes, the damning evidence of police corruption and the eye-opening events that gave Freddie this most revered reputation.",1844544834,9781844544837,320,Freddie Foreman, , ,3.60,5,0,John Blake,October 1st 2007,Hardcover,English,3011-2172421.Brown_Bread_Fred.html

2240,Crossing the Barriers: The Autobiography of Allan H. Spear,"Allan Spear had a long and distinguished career as a historian and as a Minnesota state senator. Perhaps best known for coming out as openly gay during his first term in the Minnesota Senate-becoming one of the first elected officials in the nation to do so-Spear was also a leader of Eugene McCarthy's run for the presidency, an organizer against the war in Vietnam, and a key proponent for the establishment of the African-American studies department at the University of Minnesota. Spear's memoirs are fascinating and moving: in early chapters on his childhood and college years, he writes with great introspection about his growing self-awareness of being gay. Later he writes about his development as an intellectual, particularly as a white man fighting to win legitimacy for the study of African-American history and culture. During his time at the University of Minnesota, Spear became deeply involved with the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) and the antiwar movement. At the same time, Spear became increasingly active in the emerging gay rights movement and began the process of coming out to his friends and colleagues. After a failed run for the Minnesota House in 1968, Spear was elected to the Minnesota Senate in 1972 and served as Senate president from 1993-2000. In 1993, he was instrumental in the passage of the Minnesota Human Rights Act, which protected LGBT people from discrimination in housing, education, and employment-an achievement he considered one of the finest of his career. A skilled parliamentarian, he remained a progressive leader in the legislature until his retirement in 2000. Spear passed away on October 11, 2008, leaving his memoir slightly incomplete. A stirring afterword by John Milton completes the story of Spear's life, chronicling the recognition of his accomplishments as a politician and activist during his final years.",0816670404,9780816670406,456,Allan H.

2241,A Mind Always in Motion: The Autobiography of Emilio Segre,"The renowned physicist Emilio Segrè (1905-1989) left his memoirs to be published posthumously because, he said, ""I tell the truth the way it was and not the way many of my colleagues wish it had been."" This compelling autobiography offers a personal account of his fascinating life as well as candid portraits of some of this century's most important scientists, such as Enrico Fermi, E. O. Lawrence, and Robert Oppenheimer. Born in Italy to a well-to-do Jewish family, Segrè showed early signs of scientific genius—at age seven he began a notebook of physics experiments. He became Fermi's first graduate student in 1928 and contributed to the discovery of slow neutrons, and later was appointed director of the physics laboratory at the University of Palermo. While visiting the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley in 1938, he learned that he had been dismissed from his Palermo post by Mussolini's Fascist regime. Lawrence then hired him to work on the cyclotron at Berkeley with Luis Alvarez, Edwin McMillan, and Glenn Seaborg. Segrè was one of the first to join Oppenheimer at Los Alamos, where he became a group leader on the Manhattan Project. His account of that mysterious enclave of scientists, all working feverishly to develop the atomic bomb before the Nazis did, includes his description of the first explosion at Alamogordo. Segrè writes movingly of the personal devastation wrought by the Nazis, his struggles with fellow scientists, and his love of nature. His book offers an intimate glimpse into a bygone era as well as a unique perspective on some of the most important scientific developments of this century.",0520076273,9780520076273,332,Emilio Segrè, , ,3.50,2,0,University of California Press,October 7th 1993,Hardcover,English,3019-3181113-a-mind-always-in-motion.html

In so doing, it makes very important broader points about the use of life histories in social science research in general and in the study of South Asian social-cultural life in particular."" --Sarah Lamb Life histories have a wide, if not universal, appeal. But what does it mean to narrate the story of a life, whether one's own or someone else's, orally or in writing? Which lives are worth telling, and who is authorized to tell them? The essays in this volume consider these questions through close examination of a wide range of biographies, autobiographies, diaries, and oral stories from India. Their subjects range from literary authors to housewives, politicians to folk heroes, and include young and old, women and men, the illiterate and the learned.

2244,Forbidden Narratives: Critical Autobiography as Social Science,"Forbidden Narratives: Critical Autobiography as Social Science explores overlapping layers of voices and stories that convey the social relations of psychiatric survivor participation within a community mental health service system. It is written from the perspective of a woman who, in the course of working with the survivor movement, had a physical and emotional breakdown. Ironically, the author found herself personally confronted with issues she typically dealt with only from a distance: as a mental health professional, a researcher, and an activist. The author of this volume writes herself into her work as a major character. Narratives such as this have traditionally been forbidden as outside proper professional standards. Now they are claiming and receiving attention. Forbidden Narratives has the power to speak to a broad audience not only of mental health professionals but also policy makers, sociologists and feminists. It is about the breaking up of professional discourse. It demonstrates and signals profound changes in the social sciences.",2884492127,9782884492126,176,Kathryn Church, , ,3.00,1,0,Routledge,April 1st 1996,Hardcover,English,3021-1834016.Forbidden_Narratives.html

2246,Caribbean Autobiography: Cultural Identity and Self-representation (Wisconsin Studies in Autobiography),"Despite the range and abundance of autobiographical writing from the Anglophone Caribbean, this book is the first to explore this literature fully. It covers works from the colonial era up to present-day AIDS memoirs and assesses the links between more familiar works by George Lamming, C. L. R. James, Derek Walcott, V. S. Naipaul, and Jamaica Kincaid and less frequently cited works by the Hart sisters, Mary Prince, Mary Seacole, Claude McKay, Yseult Bridges, Jean Rhys, Anna Mahase, and Kamau Brathwaite. Sandra Pouchet Paquet charts the intersection of multiple, contradictory viewpoints of the colonial and postcolonial Caribbean, differing concepts of community and levels of social integration, and a persistent pattern of both resistance and accommodation within island states that were largely shaped by British colonial practice from the mid-seventeenth through the mid-twentieth century. The texts examined here reflect the entire range of autobiographical practice, including the slave narrative and testimonial, written and oral narratives, spiritual autobiographies, fiction, serial autobiography, verse, diaries and journals, elegy, and parody.",0299176940,9780299176945,368,Sandra Pouchet Paquet, , ,3.00,1,0,University of Wisconsin Press,June 7th 2002,Paperback, ,3023-2803406-caribbean-autobiography.html

Twain s own introduction says it all: GREETINGS, STRANGER OF THE FUTURE. If you are reading this, it means the written word has survived, that the world of tomorrow still exists, and that for some reason my ramblings are still considered worth reading. My name is Mark Twain, and I write these words to you in the good old days of August 2010. What s that, you say, didn t you die a hundred years ago, you old coot? I hear your memoirs have just been published, right now in 2010, because they had to wait a century after your death, blah blah blah and so on. The truth is I never died, but the same old rumors got exaggerated and then the Great War happened, so people forgot I was still alive. And I ve kept alive, due to a magic spell cast upon me by a wizard but I ve promised not to tell that tale until 1,000 years have passed. I let them do the century book because otherwise I might have to pay the advance back again, and I couldn t afford it. I suppose by now you all know how I was Jack the Ripper, and why it was in a good cause that I committed those foul murders. Also that I was directly responsible for the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln.

'One of the most charismatic and flamboyant cyclists in recent history' Daily Telegraph Laurent Fignon is one of the giants of modern cycling. Twice-winner of the Tour de France in the early eighties, Fignon became the star for a new generation. In 1989 he took part in one of the most fiercely-contested Tours of all time. Over the course of 3,285 kilometres he lost out to his American arch-rival, Greg LeMond, by an agonising eight seconds on the final Parisian time trial. In this forthright and unflinching account the former champion spares neither friends nor opponents, nor even himself. In doing so he gives cycling fans a tantalising glimpse of what really went on behind the scenes of this epic sport - the friendships, the rivalries, the betrayals, the scheming, the parties, the girls, and, of course, the performance-enhancing drugs. Laurent Fignon lived cycling at its peak. He enjoyed a truly exceptional career, winning over eighty titles from 1982 to 1993. The highs were matched by lows of serious injury, periods of self-doubt, and accusations of cheating. Fignon's story bestrides a golden age in cycling: a time when the headlines spoke of heroes, not doping, and a time when cyclists were afraid of nothing. Laurent Fignon was born in Paris in 1960. He won the Tour de France in 1983 and 1984 and the Giro d'Italia in 1989. In June 2009, Fignon revealed that he was being treated for advanced intestinal cancer and he died in August 2010.",0224083198,9780224083195,304,Laurent Fignon,William Fotheringham, ,3.95,329,34,Yellow Jersey,June 10th 2010,Paperback,English,306-8057326-we-were-young-and-carefree.html

2313,The Autobiography of Satan,"The unclean spirit is man's spirit of moral impurity, which, weak for good, is powerful for evil. And that impure spirit breeds moral disorder, and moral disorder occasions impotence; and when man has lost his moral power, he is held and scourged by his own wickedness. For wickedness, substitute ""the wicked one"" by an act of impersonation, and you have before you the birth, growth and prevalence of the New Testament possession, so far as man's constitution is concerned. Owing to the strong tendencies which sprang up under these circumstances, the notion and the recognition of a second self arose more or less in all nations, and emphatically in tribes and individuals with whom imagination was vivid and active. And this natural and inevitable dualism has a bad being for one of its constituents. I am, then, the natural offspring of humanity. I am an image of the human mind. But then what at the bottom am 11 When all personification is removed, and figures of speech laid aside, I sink into man; I am a human being, who, as such, has two-fold moral tendencies, the one which lift him up, and the other which drag him down. Yet in this description imagery intrudes itself. To avoid imagery is very difficult. I will, however, say that one direction within you injures you, and the other benefits you: but even here the inevitable dualism recurs, and makes you two somewhats--a ""direction"" and a ""you,"" whereas in fact that direction is nothing but a form or state of the you, that is yourself.

As a young woman she fell deeply in love with Lord Vishnu, composing fervent poems and songs in his honor and, according to custom, eventually marrying the god himself. The Autobiography of a Goddess is Andal’s entire corpus, composed before her marriage to Vishnu, and it cements her status as the South Indian corollary to Mirabai, the saint and devotee of Sri Krishna. The collection includes the Thiruppavai , a song still popular in congregational worship, thirty pasuram (stanzas) sung before Lord Vishnu, and the less-translated, rapturously erotic Nacchiyar Thirumoli . Priya Sarrukai Chabria and Ravi Shankar serve as master translators for the volume, employing a radical new method for that revitalizes classical and spiritual verse by shifting it into a new contemporary poetic idiom in English.

Over 20 years, almost 2000 ""cousins"" passed through the Djalili's doors, and the young Omid played translator to each. Although these years taught him a lot about the rich tapestry of life, this parenting by committee led to a slightly checkered school career which saw Omid taking his A levels a record six times, and eventually fake his own university entrance papers. Desperate to be free of his cramped living quarters he escapes to the University of Ulster, where he lives a life of wonderful solitude.

Much, much more than just another tale of rock 'n' roll debauchery, it's a story of heartbreak and loss--and, ultimately, triumph. In it, Cavalera offers an unflinching account of life growing up in hardship in Brazil--a country not previously known for heavy metal--and the multi-million-selling success, against all odds, of the band he founded with his brother, Iggor: Sepultura. Then, for the first time, he reveals the full story behind his split with the band--after which he did not speak to his brother for years--and the formation of his Soulfly, one of the most critically and commercially successful metal bands of the past two decades. He also goes into unflinching detail on the devastating impact of the deaths of his father, stepson, and grandson; his struggles with drugs and alcohol; and his eventual reunion with Iggor in The Cavalera Conspiracy. Max Cavalera's has a unique and extraordinary story to tell, and My Bloody Roots is an autobiography like no other.

His early memories include being taught to sing by the great composer Benjamin Britten, and later, when he entered show business, his friendships with David Hemmings, John Lennon, and Oliver Reed. There are also stories of Crawford ""making a fool of himself"" in front of idols Gene Kelly and Barbra Streisand while filming ""Hello Dolly"". Starring in ""Barnum"" and ""The Phantom of the Opera"", Crawford became a huge international star, but this engaging memoir rarely strays from the honest and self-deprecating qualities that have endeared him to his many fans.",0712684409,9780712684408,330,Michael Crawford, , ,3.92,124,28,Century,January 4th 1999,Hardcover,English,3104-3929367-parcel-arrived-safely.html
2323,"And Speaking of Scorpions...: Autobiography of Former Scorpions Drummer Herman ""Ze German"" Rarebell","Defying odds longer than that of Arcangues winning the 1993 Breeder's Cup Classic horse race, the Scorpions rose to rock and roll royalty from relative obscurity in Hannover, West Germany during the late 1970's and early 1980's. Herman Rarebell, aka Herman ""Ze German,"" was part of it all. More than just a drummer, Herman's additional input through his imaginative and inspired songwriting was conceivably the key ingredient and missing component that led to their rise to prominence while most of those in the so-called ""know"" said they were only kidding themselves. Dieter Dierks, the long time producer of the Scorpions says: Herman was an integral part in the development of that which eventually became known as the classic Scorpions sound. Music all starts with the drummer. Not many people realize this. However, if you look at the ""success"" of the group, or, perhaps more appropriately, the lack thereof, prior to the arrival of Herman ""Ze German"" as well as that which has eluded them since his departure, I think you can see exactly how pivotal his role was within the band. However, there is much more here than just the ordinary, self-glorifying chronicle of a man's life. This book is anything but that. Shrewdly concealed within this autobiography is not only what can be considered the quintessential, definitive history of arguably the greatest band of their era, but also a masterful weaving of some of the most entertaining wit, whimsy and sage wisdom ever shared within the covers of a simple book. Sure to be considered a masterpiece by those who have a love of tongue in cheek irony and satire not to mention great storytelling, it raises the bar for such offerings to a decidedly new level. With his endless anecdotes and tales, Herman draws the lines that led to the group's ascension to the Mount Olympus of rock music, while his co-writer, Michael Krikorian, clearly lends his assistance to color them in providing more hues and tones than Crayola ever put in a box of crayons. Together they set a table and serve up a banquet of sarcasm and memories truly fit for a king! (The King of Monaco to be precise.) There are no sacred cherubs spared from the harpoon of a master yarn-spinner as the puns, innuendo and endless wordplay are meant to entertain and lampoon much of the history not only of an incredible band but also of a generation. Though having none of the calories but plenty of the guilt, the frankness and honesty expressed upon each sinfully delicious page will never spoil your appetite but only leave you yearning for more.",1463601107,9781463601102,252,Herman Rarebell,Michael Krikorian, ,3.33,12,0,Createspace,August 1st 2011,Paperback,English,3105-12961303-and-speaking-of-scorpions.html
2324,Autobiography of an Ex-white Man: Learning a New Master Narrative for America,"Autobiography of an Ex-White Man is an intensely personal meditation on the nature of America by a White Philosopher who joined a Black Studies Department and found his understanding of the world transformed by the experience. The book begins with an autobiographical narrative of the events leading up to Wolff's transfer from a Philosophy Department to the W. E. B. Du Bois Department of Afro-American Studies at the University of Massachusetts, and his experiences in the Department with his new colleagues, all of whom had come to Academia from the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. Wolff discovered that the apparently simple act of moving across campus to a new Department in a new building worked a startling change in the way he saw himself, his university, and his country. Reading as widely as possible to bring himself up to speed in his new field of academic responsibility, Wolff realized after a bit that his picture of American history and culture was undergoing an irreversible metamorphosis. America, he realized, has from its inception been a land both of Freedom and of Bondage: Freedom for the few, and then for those who are White; Bondage at first for the many, and then for those who are not White. Slavery is thus not an aberration, an accident, a Peculiar Institution -- it is the essence and core of the American experience. Wolff's optimistic outlook leads him to express the hope that our acknowledging the realities of America's racial history and present will begin to tear down the formidable barrier to change. He sees this refashioning of the American story as a first step toward the crafting of a truly liberatory project. Robert Paul Wolff is Professor of Afro-American Studies at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and the author of numerous books, including Introductory Philosophy and In Defense of Anarchism.",1580461808,9781580461801,150,Robert Paul Wolff, , ,4.00,5,1,University of Rochester Press,March 17th 2005,Hardcover,English,3106-2068951.Autobiography_of_an_Ex_white_Man.html

2331,Pocket Rocket: Don't Quit!: The Autobiography of Wayne McCullough,"When, in 2000, following an annual MRI scan, Wayne McCullough was diagnosed as having a cyst on his brain and told he might never box again, he began the longest struggle of his controversial career. The BBBC withheld his licence to fight in the UK, then, just when it seemed he would never box in Britain again, the decision was reversed. He returned to his beloved Belfast in 2002 to defeat Russian Nikolai Eremeev in a dramatic fourth-round victory. From his early life on the Shankill Road to training with the great Eddie Futch in Las Vegas, Pocket Rocket: Don't Quit! details the ups and downs of McCullough's life as a world champion boxer and as an ambassador for his sport and his country. Raised during Northern Ireland's Troubles in one of Belfast's toughest areas, McCullough chose to use his fists in the ring. In 1995 he finally achieved his dream when he was crowned WBC bantamweight world champion, beating Yasuei Yakushiji in Nagoya, Japan. Bringing a gentleness to an often gruesome sport, Pocket Rocket: Don't Quit! is an honest account of Wayne McCullough's life in his own words. He writes about Mat Tinley, the TV executive who took him to the States to embark on his boxing career as a pro, and gives an account of his major fights, including gruelling contests against Naseem Hamed, Erik Morales and Scott Harrison. He describes the labour of love that has been boxing for him since the age of eight and looks to the future, after his second defeat at the hands of Oscar Larios. Will he have the chance to take back the six minutes of his boxing life that were stolen from him by the ringside doctor who stopped his 2005 title fight? McCullough has stood toe-to-toe with 11 world champions and remained on his feet to the end.

In making the condition for its own possibility its deepest concern, philosophy is necessarily about itself_it is autobiographical. The first part of The Autobiography of Philosophy interprets Heidegger's Being and Time, Nietzsche's On the Genealogy of Morals, Aristotle's Metaphysics, and Plato's Lysis as examples of the implicitly autobiographical character of philosophy. The second part is a reading of Rousseau's The Reveries of the Solitary Walker. Although Rousseau's explicitly autobiographical writings are more often read for the tantalizing details of his rather eccentric life than for their philosophical import, this work is an artful use of Rousseau's exile and isolation_'the strangest position in which a mortal could ever find himself'_as a paradigm for the human soul in its relation to the world.

2358,Chris Hoy: The Autobiography,"The first Briton to win three Olympic golds at the same Games, Scotland’s Chris Hoy is a genuine sports superhero. His autobiography charts the life of a seven-year-old BMX fanatic, supported by a devoted dad and his local cycling club, through paralyzing self-doubt and a major career overhaul, to the sport’s Holy Grail. This 32-year-old cycling fanatic from Musselburgh in the suburbs of Edinburgh defied the doubters who thought he would struggle when his specialist discipline, the 1km time trial, was dropped from the Olympics, and went on to reinvent himself as a track cycling sprinter and triple Olympic gold medalist in Beijing. His return to these shores sparked unprecedented celebrations and real admiration that here was a role model who was the epitome of all things that are good in sport. What makes a champion in sport? In his autobiography, Hoy returns to his roots as a child fully engaged with the BMX craze of the 1980s; when, even as a spotty seven-year-old his will to succeed allied to an unyielding mental strength set him apart from other youngsters of his age. A promising rower and rugby player in school, it was when he joined his first local cycling club and spent most weekends of the year competing in national events from Blackpool to Bristol that the seeds of his future career were sown.",000731132X,9780007311323,352,Chris Hoy, , ,3.79,87,12,HarperCollins UK,June 1st 2010,Paperback,English,3137-9256885-chris-hoy.html

2360,And the Walls Came Tumbling Down: An Autobiography,"Originally published in 1989, this beautifully written autobiography of the Rev. Dr. Ralph David AbernathyMartin Luther King Jr.'s partner and eventual successornot only tells his own story but also expounds on the leaders he knew intimately, including King, Jesse Jackson, Andrew Young, and Lyndon Johnson, among others. Revealing the planning that went into major protests and the negotiations that brought them to a close, Abernathy chronicles a movement, recalling the bitter defeats they faced, the misery and deaths they suffered. Amidst these struggles, though, he celebrates the victories that integrated communities, gave economic and political power to the disenfranchised, and brought hope to people who had not dreamed of it. Throughout, Abernathy's close relationship with King is central to the storyand to the civil rights movement. In 1956, when Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus, it was Abernathy who enlisted King to join the protest. Together, they led the landmark bus boycott for 381 days, during which Abernathy’s house was bombed and his church dynamited. From there, the two helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and they were jailed together more than 40 times. Their protests and marches took them all over the SouthSelma, Albany, Birminghamand to Washington and Chicago as well. An unsung hero of his era, Abernathy's inspiring memoir ultimately shows how their victories, and even their setbacks, led to social and legislative changes across the entire country.",1569762791,9781569762790,672,Ralph David Abernathy, , ,3.95,62,12,Chicago Review Press,April 1st 2010,Paperback,English,3139-8414585-and-the-walls-came-tumbling-down.html

2362,The Player: The Autobiography,"In this frank, tell-all autobiography, the German tennis genius reveals the highs and lows of his life both on and off the court. Boris Becker shot to fame in 1985 when at seventeen years old, he became the youngest player ever to win the men’s final at Wimbledon. He went on to win two more Wimbledon titles, and a total of forty-nine singles and fifteen doubles crowns, making him one of the greatest players of the twentieth century. But his life off the court has always attracted as much attention as his triumphs on it. Now, in this remarkably candid and thought-provoking autobiography, Boris Becker tells the real story behind the headlines. He speaks of the seconds before the serve that made him the youngest Wimbledon winner of all time, and of the minutes after being sentenced as a tax evader. He talks about his marriage, his illegitimate daughter, and his painful divorce. He reveals his emotions at the end of his tennis career, and his battles with pills and alcohol. He also shares his memories of the good times, the championship wins, the make-or-break matches, and the highs and lows of life on the international circuit. Boris Becker has written this autobiography not just for his fans but also for his children, that they may one day read the true account of their father’s remarkable, and often controversial, life.",0593053443,9780593053447,320,Boris Becker, , ,3.36,109,12,Bantam Press,September 1st 2004,Hardcover,English,3140-6640712-the-player.html

""Born Franklin Birkinshaw in 1931, Fay spent most of her youth in New Zealand. With her glamorous father, a philandering doctor, generally absent, Fay's intrepid mother and bohemian grandmother raised her along with her sister, Jane.

She has maintained this unique position through four turbulent decades. At first, she managed to scrape along, penning winning advertising slogans, before she began to write fiction. As this memoir comes to a close, we witness the stirring of her first novel."" Riddled with Weldon's customarily fierce opinions, this frank and absorbing memoir is vintage Fay.

2394,"Nearer, My God: An Autobiography of Faith","This is the story of one man's faith, told with unrivaled reflection and candor. William F. Buckley, Jr., was raised a Catholic. As the world plunged into war, and as social mores changed dramatically around him, Buckley's faith -- a most essential part of his make-up -- sustained him. In Nearer, My God, Buckley examines in searching detail the meaning of his faith, and how his life has been shaped and sustained by religious conviction. In highly personal terms, and with the wit and acuity for which he is justly renowned, Buckley discusses vital issues of Catholic doctrine and practice, and in so doing outlines for the reader both the nature of CathoLic faith and the essential role of religious belief in everyday life. In powerfully felt prose, he contributes provocatively and intelligently to the national interest in the nature of religion, the Church, and spiritual development. Nearer, My God is sure to appeal to all readers who have felt the stirrings of their own religious faith, and who want confirmation of their beliefs or who are seeking a guide to understanding their own souls. The renowned social and political commentator, William F. Buckley Jr., turns to a highly personal subject -- his faith. And he tells us the story of his life as a Catholic Christian. ""Nearer, My God"" is the most reflective, poignant, and searching of Bill Buckley's many books. In the opening chapters he relives his childhood, a loving, funny, nostalgic glimpse into pre-World War II America and England. He speaks about his religious experiences to a world that has changed dramatically. He is unafraid of revealing the most personal side of his faith. He describes, in his distinctive style, the intimacy of a trip to Lourdes, the impact on him of the searing account by Maria Valtorta of the Crucifixion, the ordination of his nephew into the priesthood, and gives a moving account of his mother's death. And there is humor, as Buckley gives a unique, hilarious view of a visit to the Vatican with Malcolm Muggeridge, Charlton Heston, Grace Kelly, and David Niven. Personal though this book is, Buckley has gone to others to examine new perspectives, putting together his own distinguished 'Forum' and leaning on the great literature of the past to illustrate his thinking on contemporary Catholic and Christian issues.",0156006189,9780156006187,336,William F.

2413,Willie Morgan On The Wing - My Autobiography,"There have been some extraordinary footballers over the decades. But few with a story as extraordinary as Willie Morgan. A Manchester United icon, the Scot fought all the odds to make it to the very top of the English game during its most fascinating and fashionable era, the 1960s and 1970s. But it is not just Morgan’s life on the pitch that is so captivating. Growing up in the tiny mining village of Sauchie, Morgan was raised believing his grandparents were his parents because his real mother had given birth to him outside wedlock. Not only that, but Morgan’s father was an Italian prisoner of war from World War Two. It seemed that young Willie was destined for life as a family outcast, forced to follow his family into working the area’s coalmines. However, Morgan’s path was different. For he had a remarkable skill – the speed and ability to play football like nobody else. His skills were spotted by Burnley in 1960 before Morgan’s life changed forever when legendary Manchester United manager Sir Matt Busby broke the British transfer record to land the winger, and hand him George Best’s No.7 shirt. It was from the right wing – and that shirt – that Morgan would witness and play with some of the greatest Manchester United players of all time. Morgan recounts hundreds of tales about the hell-raising Best as well as giving his verdicts on the likes of Denis Law, Bobby Charlton, Alex Stepney, Paddy Crerand and a host of others. He also talks about Wilf McGuinness and the case he had to fight against former United manager Tommy Docherty. From the football pitch to the High Court – Morgan has done it all and seen it all. He entertained, captivated and thrilled football fans for over 20 years. Now, for the first time, read his fascinating life story…",, ,216,Willie Morgan, , ,3.50,2,0,Trinity Mirror Sport Media,November 22nd 2013,Kindle Edition,English,3187-19157004-willie-morgan-on-the-wing---my-autobiography.html

2420,Harriet Martineau's Autobiography Part One,"Harriet Martineau (1802 1876) was a British writer who was one of the first social theorists to examine all aspects of a society, including class, religion, national character and the status of women. These volumes, first published in 1877, contain Martineau's unusual autobiography. Written in three months in 1855 when she believed herself to be dying of heart disease, the original two volumes remained unaltered despite her recovery and continued writing. The third volume, covering the remainder of Martineau's life, was written by her friend and literary executor, Maria Chapman, who had access to Martineau's private papers. These works were the first substantial published account of Martineau's life and work, and remain a remarkable example of the genre for Martineau's vivid descriptions and candid, outspoken opinions of Victorian society. Volume 1 covers her life until 1834.

His career began one night in a pub in Chorlton when a comedian didn't arrive for his set and Jason, the 17-year-old glass collector stepped in to fill the gap. From that point on he's never looked back, until now that is... This is the story in his own words of everything that lead up to that fateful moment - a colourful tale of growing up with lots of family and not enough money, of getting by and sticking together.

It is based on Humphrey's own writings: statements prepared for dance journals, correspondence with family and friends, and the autobiography she did not live to complete. The personal account of her growing years, her decade of association with Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, and her collaborations with Charles Weidman and Jose Limon are included.

2424,Chasing the Dream: An Autobiography,"""Maybe the good Lord was just waiting for me to put on the pinstripes."" When Joe Torre was fired as manager of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1995, he thought his career in baseball was over. After more than three decades and 4,200 games as a player and manager, one thing had always eluded him--winning a World Series. He had all but given up his dream when the New York Yankees made him an offer to manage their 1996 club. Encouraged by his wife and others, he accepted, and so began one of the greatest seasons in the fabled history of the New York Yankee franchise and one of the most inspiring, heartwarming stories in all of baseball. Here is the ultimate insider's record of that unforgettable season by the man whose personal struggles captured the hearts and imaginations of fans everywhere. Tough, gritty, but always fair and honest, Torre vividly reveals how he turned a potentially volatile mix of talented youngsters such as Andy Pettitte and Derek Jeter, seasoned veterans like Wade Boggs and Paul O'Neill, and so-called ""problem"" players like Darryl Strawberry and Dwight Gooden into a cohesive unit that cared more about winning than personal egos. He explains how he played his hunches and earned his team's confidence and respect as he focused his players from spring training on toward one goal: the World Series. And he did it all in a pressure-filled sports city that expects nothing less than a champion. But how he did it is only part of this remarkable story. For at the same time that Torre was overcoming the odds on the field, his family was facing much greater hardships off the field. He speaks candidly and emotionally of the tragedy of his oldest brother Rocco's sudden death, and the agonizing ordeal of his other older brother, Frank, who waited for the heart transplant that could save his life. It was his wife, Ali, who gave him the faith to believe anything was possible. Together with his sisters Rae and Sister Marguerite, a nun from Queens, they dared to dream the impossible. In a fairy-tale ending not even the best Hollywood scriptwriter could imagine, Frank Torre got his new heart the day before the Yankees won their first World Series championship since 1978--and Joe Torre won his first ever. Here is Joe Torre's own story--told for the first time in his own words--from his early childhood in Brooklyn, to his celebrated baseball career playing with the likes of Hank Aaron and Bob Gibson, to his stint as the first native New Yorker ever to manage the Yankees. Offering a rare behind-the-scenes look at a season to remember and a man who went through so much to reach the pinnacle of his profession, Chasing the Dream is more than just another sports story. It is a poignant reminder of why we love the game--and how, sometimes, nice guys do finish first.

In this, the first volume of his autobiography, Powell captures the startling momentum of his early career, which began while he was still in his teens when a serendipitous meeting with the great silent filmmaker Rex Ingram garnered him a job at Victorine Studios. From there he went on to apprentice with Alfred Hitchcock and then to Alexander Korda's studio, where he would meet Emeric Pressburger, his principal collaborator for many years. With wit and candor Powell recalls their astounding work together on such classics as Black Narcissus and The Red Shoes -- all of this narrated in his inimitable prose. But A Life in Movies is more than just one man's story. Full of politics, intrigue, glamour, and grit, it's a fast-paced, atmospheric ride that sheds new light on the early days of the film business.",043459945X,9780434599455,705,Michael  Powell, , ,4.53,53,4,Heinemann,1986,Hardcover, ,3201-7044090-a-life-in-movies.html

2435,To The Stars: Autobiography of George Takei (Star Trek: All),"Best known as Mr. Sulu, helmsman of the Starship Enterprise ™ and captain of the Starship Excelsior , George Takei is beloved by millions as part of the command team that has taken audiences to new vistas of adventure in Star Trek ®—the unprecedented television and feature film phenomenon. From the program’s birth in the changing world of the 1960s and death at the hands of the network to its rebirth in the hearts and minds of loyal fans, the Star Trek story has blazed its own path into our recent cultural history, leading to a series of blockbuster feature films and three new versions of Star Trek for television. The Star Trek story is one of boundless hope and crushing disappointment, wrenching rivalries and incredible achievements. It is also the story of how, after nearly thirty years, the cast of characters from a unique but poorly rated television show have come to be known to millions of Americans and people around the world as family. For George Takei, the Star Trek adventure is intertwined with his personal odyssey through adversity in which four-year-old George and his family were forced by the United States government into internment camps during World War II. Star Trek means much more to George Takei than an extraordinary career that has spanned thirty years. For an American whose ideals faced such a severe test, Star Trek represents a shining embodiment of the American Dream—the promise of an optimistic future in which people from all over the world contribute to a common destiny.",, ,416,George Takei, , ,4.14,7,0,Gallery Books,March 10th 2015,Kindle Edition,English,3207-25178164-to-the-stars.html

Completed just before Emily Carr died in 1945, Growing Pains tells the story of Carr’s life, beginning with her girlhood in pioneer Victoria and going on to her training as an artist in San Francisco, England and France. Also here is the frustration she felt at the rejection of her art by Canadians, of the years of despair when she stopped painting. She had to earn a living, and did so by running a small apartment-house, and her painful years of landladying and more joyful times raising dogs for sale, claimed all her time and energy. Then, towards the end of her life, came unexpected vindication and triumph when the Group of Seven accepted her as one of them. Throughout, the book is informed with Carr’s passionatate love of and connection with nature. Carr is a natural storyteller whose writing is vivid and vital, informed by wit, nostalgic charm, an artist’s eye for description, a deep feeling for creatures and the foibles of humanity--all the things that made her previous books Klee Wyck and Book of Small so popular and critically acclaimed.",1553650832,9781553650836,400,Emily Carr,Ira Dilworth,Robin Laurence,4.02,178,27,Douglas & McIntyre,March 18th 2005,Paperback,English,322-149182.Growing_Pains.html

2451,Lithuania Independent Again: The Autobiography of Vytautas Landsbergis,"On January 13, 1991, thousands of unarmed Lithuanians rallied to defend Parliament against encircling Soviet tanks and many were crushed beneath their tracks. Television pictures flashed around the world, revealing the reality of Gorbachev's Soviet Union and stirring the world's conscience. These dramatic events were crucial not only for the re-emergence of an independent Lithuania but for the breakup of the Soviet Union.Vytautas Landsbergis was the first president of the new independent Lithuania and leader of his people on that memorable night. In this book he retraces the process which led to Lithuania's independence and admission to the United Nations: the shifting positions of Gorbachev and Yeltsin; the attitudes of Bush, Thatcher, and Mitterand; the solidarity with the other Baltic states; the struggle between old Communists and new democrats within Lithuania; and the machinations of the KGB. Landsbergis was born into a family of Lithuanian patriots and traces their influence as he grew up during the German and Soviet occupations. His deep involvement in the artistic and intellectual community -- he was professor of music history at the Vilnius Conservatoire -- led him into political life. An impassioned personal statement and an essential document for historians of the last days of the Soviet Empire, this autobiography also offers unique insights into the life and capacity for survival of a small culture caught in the web of big-power politics.",0295979593,9780295979595,387,Vytautas Landsbergis,Eimutis Sova, ,3.00,3,1,University of Washington Press,April 1st 2000,Hardcover,English,3221-5692008-lithuania-independent-again.html
2452,A Lifetime of Labor: The Autobiography of Alice H. Cook,"The work of the indefatigable Alice Hanson Cook benefitted the lives of working people—and especially working women—on four continents. A pioneer in union organizing, worker education, and equal rights for working women, Cook carried on her path-blazing work across the country and around the world, across racial, ethnic, national, and class lines, and across boundaries she refused to accept were impassable. In A Lifetime of Labor, called ""a deeply satisfying memoir"" by the Times-Picayune, Cook recounts a life of activism, teaching, and research that spanned nearly a century and intersected with progressive movements at home and abroad. Cook lucidly recalls the many phases of her long and remarkable career, including her years of research on creating just and viable options for working women. As the Syracuse Herald-Journal noted, ""Cook helped bring to the public issues as equal pay and comparable worth, maternity leave and support programs for working mothers."" Alice Cook's autobiography, written when she was in her eighties and nineties, is a unique document in social history, an important record of her ground-breaking thought and research, and a matter-of-fact account of a life devoted to justice and lived to the fullest.

2455,"Autobiography and Decolonization: Modernity, Masculinity, and the Nation-State","Philip Holden reveals deeply gendered connections between the writing of individual lives and of the narratives of nations emerging from colonialism. Autobiography and Decolonization is the first book to give serious academic attention to autobiographies of nationalist leaders in the process of decolonization, attending to them not simply as partial historical documents, but as texts involved in remaking the world views of their readers. Holden examines Mohandas K. Gandhi’s An Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments with Truth , Marcus Garvey’s fragmentary Autobiography ,Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford’s Ethiopia Unbound , Lee Kuan Yew’s The Singapore Story , Nelson Mandela’s Long Walk to Freedom , Jawaharlal Nehru’s An Autobiography , and Kwame Nkrumah’s Ghana: The Autobiography of Kwame Nkrumah . Holden argues that these examples of life writing have had significant influence on the formation of new, and often profoundly gendered, national identities. These narratives constitute the nation less as an imagined community than as an imagined individual. Moving from the past to the promise of the future, they mediate relationships between public and private, and between individual and collective stories. Ultimately, they show how the construction of modern selfhood is inextricably linked to the construction of a postcolonial polity.",0299226107,9780299226107,296,Philip Holden, , ,3.67,3,0,University of Wisconsin Press,May 19th 2008,Hardcover,English,3225-6991479-autobiography-and-decolonization.html
2456,"My History, Not Yours: The Formation of Mexican American Autobiography","""I am willing to relate all I can remember, but I wish it clearly understood that it must be in my own way, and at my own time. I will not be hurried or dictated to. It is my history and not yours I propose to tell.”—Mariano Guadelupe Vallejo, on “Recuerdos históricos y personales” (1875) My History, Not Yours is a landmark study of the autobiographical writings of Mexican Americans in the century following the US-Mexican War of 1846-1848. Some 75,000 inhabitants of what is now Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California were suddenly foreigners on their own lands. Faced with the deliberate obliteration of their history, culture, language, and personal experiences, these women and men set down the stories of their lives and their communities, as a means of both remembering and resisting. Genaro M. Padilla and other scholars have begun to uncover the huge store of literary materials forgotten in manuscript archives: memoirs long out of print, others unpublished and unread, diaries, family histories, poetry, correspondence, and texts of corridos (ballads). Padilla writes, “Lives are scattered on broken pages, faded, partially lost at the margins, suspended in language unread until there is a reader who opens the file and begins. It is my intention to initiate a recovery of that autobiographical formation that emerged after a war of conquest.” In providing an overview of this rich literature, Padilla also points out the power relations embedded in the narratives, showing that the reconstruction of the Mexican past was not merely nostalgic idealization, but often an angry and deeply politicized recovery of a world ruptured by American domination.",0299139743,9780299139742,224,Genaro M.

2457,Writing Desire: Sixty Years of Gay Autobiography,"Exploring nearly sixty years of memoir and autobiography, Writing Desire examines the changing identity of gay men writing within a historical context. Distinguished scholar and psychoanalyst Bertram J. Cohler has carefully selected a diverse group of ten men, including historians, activists, journalists, poets, performance artists, and bloggers, whose life writing evokes the evolution of gay life in twentieth-century America. By contrasting the personal experience of these disparate writers, Cohler illustrates the social transformations that these men helped shape. Among Cohler's diverse subjects is Alan Helms, whose journey from Indiana to New York's gay society represents the passage of men who came of age in the 1950s and 1960s, when homosexuality was considered a hidden ""disease."" The liberating effects of Stonewall's aftermath are chronicled in the life of Arnie Kantrowitz, the prototypical activist for gay rights in the 1970s and the founder the Gay and Lesbian Alliance against Defamation. The artistic works of Tim Miller and Mark Doty evoke loss and shock during of the early stages of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. Cohler rounds out this collective group portrait by looking at the newest generation of writers in the Internet age via the blog of BrYaN, who did the previously unthinkable: he ""outed"" himself to millions of people.

Terry takes us behind the scenes of jazz history as he introduces scores of legendary greats—Ella Fitzgerald, Oscar Peterson, Dizzy Gillespie, Dinah Washington, Doc Severinsen, Ray Charles, Thelonious Monk, Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, Coleman Hawkins, Zoot Sims, and Dianne Reeves, among many others.

2463,Autobiography of Edward Gibbon - As Originally Edited by Lord Sheffield,"AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF EDWARD GIBBON AS ORIGINALLY EDITED BY LORD SHEFFIELD WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY J. B. BURY BOMETIME ICEGIUS -- EDWARD GIBBON -- Born, Putney . . 27 April 1737 Died, St. Jamess Street, London 16 January 1794 The Miscellaneous Works of Xdward Gibbon, Esq., with Memoirs of his Life and Writings composed by himself, illustrated from his letters, with occasional notes and narrative, by the Right flonourable John, Lord Sheflelcl, were jirst published in two volumes in 1796, and a second edition, in jive aolumes, appeared i n 1814. THE title under which Gibbon intended that his autobiography should appear was Memoirs of my Life and Writings, but it will always be known as the Autobiography, the name under which, posthumously published by his friend and executor Lord Sheffield, it became a classic. Lord Sheffield gave the work its final shape and, though he performed the task, which was not an easy one, with laudable skill, we must deeply regret that the author had not himself arranged the material for publication. He left six sketches of his life, which partly supplement each other and partly cover the same ground. They were printed some years ago l, and enable us to appreciate the dexterity with which Lord Sheffield pieced togrether the consecutive narrative, adhering, he states, with scrupulous fidelity to the very words of the author. The sketches show that this statement, though generally true, is not accurate. The editor made a number of changes for various reasons. One or two cases are interesting and characteristic. Speaking of his absences from Magdalen College, Oxford, Gibbon wrote I was too young and bashful to enjoy, like a manly Oxonian, the taverns and bagnios ofConvent Garden. The last words were euphemistically changed by Lord Sheffield into the pleasures of London . Describing the pension of M. de Mesery at Lausanne, the author had simply observed that the boarders were numerous the editor makes him pretentiously tell us that the boarders were select . l The Autobiographies of Edward Gibbon. Edited by John Murray, 1896. In his solicitude not to offend contemporary English prejudices, Lord Sheffield also cut out some characteristic remarks. Referring to his essay on The Age of Sesostris, the historian had written In my supposition the high priest is guilty of a voluntary error flattery is the prolific parent of falsehood and falsehood, I will now add, is not incompatible with the sacerdotal character. Coming from the author of the Decline and Fall the remark was assuredly mild but the editor protected the sacerdotal order, and consulted the feelings of its admirers, by eliminating the last clause. That the name of the Oxford tutor who well remembered that he had a salary to receive and only forgot that he had a duty to perform Dr. Winchester should have been suppressed is intelligible, but in most cases the editorial pruning-knife was directed by English prejudices which were alien to Gibbon and with which we have no sympathy now. When Gibbon finished his Decline and Fall of the Rooman Empire, he was far from being an old man, but he had made up his mind that his life-work was completed. He composed his memoirs because he was the author of the history, and he never forgets that the historian of the Decline and Fall is telling an interested public the story of his life. He is on a stage, addressing an audience he never lets himself go, likeother great autobiographers, Cellini, or Rousseau, or Goethe...",1408631504,9781408631508,380,Gibbon E. Gibbon,Gibbon E.

2475,The Autobiography of Frau Adolf Hitler: Translated and Edited by Frank Sanello,"In his new novel, Frank Sanello vividly recreates the Third Reich and World War II as seen through the eyes and daily diary of Hitler's imaginary wife, Countess Christina Bernadotte (1916-1948). The granddaughter of the king of Sweden, the countess is forced at the age of 16 to marry the 43-year-old Nazi dictator by her socially ambitious and abusive mother, an heiress to the Vanderbilt fortune. Her husband, strung out on morphine and cocaine, makes revolting sexual demands on his virginal wife involving coprophilia, a fetish that eroticizes feces. Lonely and isolated, Frau Hitler throws herself into a series of transient love affairs with the Third Reich's handsome foreign minister, the corrupt Joachim von Ribbentrop, Cary Grant, and Ernst Rohm, leader of the SA (Storm Troopers). Because of her many romantic liaisons, she doesn't know the identity of the father of her son, Folke, except that he's not her husband's. As the Holocaust claims more victims, Christina begins smuggling Jews out of Germany right under her drug-addled husband's nose. During the war, she travels to Auschwitz to rescue Jewish friends and bribes the Gestapo to allow other Jews to flee Nazi Germany. With her uncle, Count Folke Bernadotte, she helps organize the White Buses operation, a dangerous mission that transports 30,000 Jews and POWs to safety in Sweden aboard Red Cross buses painted white to avoid bombing the Allies or the Luftwaffe. As First Lady of the Reich, she meets or corresponds with various historical figures such as Sigmund Freud, Pope Pius XII and MGM chief Louis B. Mayer. Toward the end of the war, as she tries to flee home to Sweden with her son and adopted daughter, her arch-nemesis, Hermann Goring, Hitler's second in command and pedophile, forces her to choose one of her children to leave behind with him. The choice haunts the countess until tragedy intervenes during her work as UN mediator between warring Palestinian Jews and Arabs in 1948. These dramatic events are recorded in her daily diary, which her grandson finds hidden in a Holocaust memorial library and publishes as ""The Autobiography of Frau Adolf Hitler.""",1477581723,9781477581728,252,Frank Sanello, , ,4.67,3,3,Createspace,June 1st 2012,Paperback,English,3242-15891360-the-autobiography-of-frau-adolf-hitler.html

At its core is a nineteenth-century ledger book of drawings by Lakota Sioux warriors found in 1876 in a funerary tipi on the Little Bighorn battlefield after Custer s defeat.

McLaughlin probes the complex life history of this unique artifact of cross-cultural engagement, uncovering its origins, ownership, and cultural and historic significance, and compares it with other early ledger books.

In this new, expanded edition of her autobiography, Eileen updates her story to record the events -- and emotions -- of the past fifteen years. She emerges as a powerful elderwoman who frees herself from the aura of her charismatic ex-husband Peter whom she still loves. In doing so, she learns the true nature of forgiveness, overcoming the issues of jealousy, hatred and doubt involved in the break-up of a marriage for which she had, under God's guidance, sacrificed everything. Readers will be struck by the analogy with the biblical Job, how someone who has lost everything, wealth, position, family, can yet have them restored by God.

2492,Hound Dog: The Leiber & Stoller Autobiography,"IN 1950 a couple of rhythm and blues–loving teenagers named Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met for the first time. They discovered their mutual affection for R&B and, as Jerry and Mike put it in this fascinating autobiography, began an argument that has been going on for over fifty years with no resolution in sight. Leiber and Stoller were still in their teens when they started working with some of the pioneers of rock and roll, writing such hits as ""Hound Dog,"" which eventually became a #1 record for Elvis Presley. Jerry and Mike became the King’s favorite songwriters, giving him ""Jailhouse Rock"" and other #1 songs. Their string of hits with the Coasters, including ""Yakety Yak,"" ""Poison Ivy,"" and ""Charlie Brown,"" is a part of rock ’n’ roll history. They founded their own music label and introduced novel instrumentation into their hits for the Drifters and Ben E. King, including ""On Broadway"" and ""Stand by Me."" They worked with everyone from Phil Spector to Burt Bacharach and Peggy Lee. Their smash musical Smokey Joe’s Café became the longest-running musical revue in Broadway history. Lively, colorful, and irreverent, Hound Dog describes how two youngsters with an insatiable love of good old American R&B created the soundtrack for a generation.",1416559396,9781416559399,336,Jerry Leiber,Mike Stoller,David Ritz,3.61,89,21,Simon & Schuster,June 1st 2010,Paperback,English,3251-6948215-hound-dog.html

2503,Cheech & Chong: The Unauthorized Autobiography,"Dave's Not Here, ManBut America's favorite stoner comedian, Tommy Chong, is back and funnier than ever as he takes us on a nostalgic trip through his career with partner Richard ""Cheech"" Marin. Over the course of their decades-long partnership, Cheech and Chong performed to sold-out crowds across the country, made nine hit albums, starred in eight blockbuster movies, and created memorable and iconic characters that still resonate with fans today. But the good life didn't just appear in a haze of smoke. It all started during the late 1960s in a strip club in the fragile heart of Vancouver's Chinatown, where Tommy was winding down his career as a Motown recording artist and starting an improv comedy troupe, and Cheech was a draft-dodging, pottery-throwing, underground music reviewer. Together they came to define the hippie-era counterculture, and theircelebrated movie debut, ""Up in Smoke,"" remains one of the highest-grossing Warner Bros. films ever. In his very own unauthorized autobiography, ""New York Times"" bestselling author and pop culture hero Chong reveals his unique relationship with Cheech and recalls the inspiration for their most beloved bits. He introduces famous guest stars like Peter Sellers, John Belushi, Jimi Hendrix, Dan Aykroyd, John Lennon, Diana Ross, and Jack Nicholson, and examines the influences that had the greatest impact on his comedy -- from R&B musicians and Redd Foxx to Lenny Bruce and (of course) marijuana. Finally, with keen insight and utter candor, he explores the rift that has separated the legendary comedy team for more than twenty years. From pot smoking to politics to the universe at large, ""Cheech & Chong: The Unauthorized Autobiography"" is the closestyou'll ever get to sitting in a van made entirely of marijuana, trading stories with an unlikely legend, and feeling...well...funny.",7770799856, ,224,Tommy Chong, , ,4.00,1,0,Simon Spotlight Entertainment,August 12th 2008,ebook, ,3258-18029427-cheech-chong.html

2507,"'To Sleep, Perchance.': The Autobiography of a Narcoleptic","'To Sleep... Perchance ...' is the story of one's man's battle against an incurable and life-wrecking complaint - Narcolepsy. This is a retrospective journey through the better part of half a century, tracing the many career changes, sackings, resignations, heartaches and disappointments that have been the hallmark of this debilitating disorder. From falling asleep whilst in command of armoured fighting vehicles in the sixties, 'nodding off' on horseback, 'snoozing' on parade before royalty; to 'snoring' at management meetings, walking 'zombie-like' into oncoming stacker-trucks, falling face-down into steaming dishes in restaurants, and 'turning to jelly' on experiencing emotions such as joy or sorrow have been just some of the embarrassing incidents that have punctuated the author's life. At times comic, at times tragically sad, 'To Sleep Perchance' follows the author's struggle to survive, and maintain his very sanity in the face of ignorance and indifference, not merely amongst one's colleagues, family, and friends - but even amongst the medical profession itself. As the reader is taken through the many role changes in his life, from soldier to salesman, clerical assistance to assistant cleric; controller of production to prisoner of corruption, director's table to prisoner's fable, and finally from strange buddies to academic studies, we gain an insight of what it is like to be a captive of this twilight world.",1420877976,9781420877977,344,Jonathan G.

For most of his life, he was driven by a quest for perfection and an obsession to be the best player in the world; here he shows how these two facets of his competitive mind took such a hold of him that they sent him to the top of the world, then swept him up and dragged him down in a spiral of despair. Jonny's career has spanned the far reaches: amazing high and iconic moments, then a fight against injury that culminated in a battle with depression. Here he tells of the physical toll he knew his body was taking from rugby, even from his youth; he tells of how he never wanted to be a kicking fly-half but learnt to adapt his natural game to play the style that Clive Woodward believed necessary to win a World Cup, and how he nearly walked out on Martin Johnson's England team 13 years later. Jonny is the unrelenting, brutally honest account of one of the most revered, successful and complex athletes ever to play rugby for England.""",0755313399,9780755313396,406,Jonny Wilkinson, , ,4.02,157,20,Headline,2011,Hardcover,English,327-13093828-jonny.html
2519,Antonin Raymond: An Autobiography,"As the first architect to synthesize traditional Japanese forms and ideas with the new design philosophy of the West, Antonin Raymond has been a major creative force during a great part of this century. Raymond, as a young graduate architect, had journeyed from his native Bohemia to the United States in search of the new world of architecture heralded by the achievements of Frank Lloyd Wright. He met and worked with Wright at his Taliesin home, but did not find in America the creative milieu he sought. Accompanying Wright to Japan to assist in planning and building the Imperial Hotel, Raymond responded strongly to the beauty of traditional Japanese architecture and art. In 1921, the 32-year-old Raymond began his career as an independent architect in Tokyo, adapting new technologies to the universal principles embodied in Japanese forms. Over the years, he revolutionized the arts of design and construction in Japan and created many works which now rank as milestones of modern architecture. Architecture is not the only medium in which he has distinguished himself; Raymond is an accomplished painter, sculptor and musician. As this book reveals, Raymond has been impelled toward the central events of our century. Serving as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Expeditionary Force in World War I, he was present at the inception of the Czechoslovak nation. Decorated by many governments, he was a Czechoslovak consul in pre-World War II Tokyo. Returning to that city in 1945, he witnessed its painful recovery from the devastation of the war as, earlier, he had witnessed the Great Kanto Earthquake and its aftermath. Fascinating people appear in these pages. Frank Lloyd Wright, a giant presence, is vividly depicted as a warm friend and exacting mentor, a respected colleague and a wrathful adversary. Here, too, are the poet Paul Claude, the composer Igor Stravinsky, painters and architects like Le Corbusier, Fernand Léger, Amédée Ozenfant, Taro Okamoto, Kenzo Tange, and many others. Mrs. Raymond, a distinguished painter and designer, has contributed much to the Raymond style, and her presence enlivens and enriches this account. This book will be absorbing, entertaining reading for anyone interested in the important artistic developments of our century. including 37 color plates, more than 600 black-and-white plates and illustrations, over 100 plans",0804810443,9780804810449,328,Antonin Raymond, , ,4.00,1,0,Tuttle Publishing,1973,Hardcover,English,3270-1391809.Antonin_Raymond.html

2532,Daisy: The Autobiography of a Cat,"This little story of one cat's life has been written during the intervals of a long and painful illness, when I missed the love and sympathy of my little four-footed friend of eighteen years, now, alas! nothing but a memory. Indeed, so vividly did his spirit speak to me, that I readily acknowledge him the author of this book, being myself his amanuensis. From my earliest childhood the love of animals, particularly cats, has been inherent with me. One tale of cruelty, heard by me when a child, distressed me and made me ill, and nightly the panorama of the disgusting crime would haunt my pillow. But I never regret the suffering it caused me, for it taught me my duty to our dumb friends so dependent on us. If the little stories in this book touch the hearts of its readers as that story touched mine, it will indeed have accomplished its mission. Just such stories are needed to create interest in the many societies now forming in aid of dumb animals. There are cases where one must not spare the knife, even though our tenderest and most sensitive feelings recoil, for the cure will be sure. There are crimes perpetrated every day, in the name of Science, that need just such stories to expose their iniquity. For I believe ignorance is the cause of cruelty in many instances, and a little story told attractively, where retribution follows the deed, will have more effect than reproof. I do not believe there are many hearts so callous, that a little anecdote of cruelty to these helpless creatures will not touch them",, ,0,Miranda Eliot Swan, , ,0.00,0,0,Library of Alexandria,December 27th 2012,Kindle Edition,English,3282-19706962-daisy.html

Sometimes that search seemed futile but I was always aware of an elusive something, just out of my grasp, something that every once in a while revealed itself momentarily and kept me searching.""

If being human means being fully engaged in knowing oneself, then ""Reading Under the Covers"" may inspire others who have abandoned the search for self or have never engaged in it. ""Reading Under the Covers"" is intended to generate a conversation that is missing in society today-a conversation about aging that views life as an opportunity not to be squandered, but to be cherished until the end.",0595361684,9780595361687,308,Elizabeth Russell, , ,4.00,1,0,iUniverse,August 9th 2005,Paperback,English,3298-8848535-reading-under-the-covers.html

2551,My Infamous Life: The Autobiography of Mobb Deep's Prodigy,"From one of the greatest rappers of all time, a memoir about a life almost lost and a revealing look at the dark side of hip hop’s Golden Era . . . In this often violent but always introspective memoir, Mobb Deep’s Prodigy tells his much anticipated story of struggle, survival, and hope down the mean streets of New York City. For the first time, he gives an intimate look at his family background, his battles with drugs, his life of crime, his relentless suffering with sickle-cell anemia, and much more. Recently released after serving three and a half years in state prison due to what many consider an unlawful arrest by a rumored secret NYPD hip hop task force, Prodigy is ready to talk about his life as one of rap’s greatest legends. My Infamous Life is an unblinking account of Prodigy’s wild times with Mobb Deep who, alongside rappers like Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur, Jay-Z, and Wu-Tang Clan, changed the musical landscape with their vivid portrayals of early ’90s street life. It is a firsthand chronicle of legendary rap feuds like the East Coast–West Coast rivalry; Prodigy’s beefs with Jay-Z, Nas, Snoop Dogg, Ja Rule, and Capone-N-Noreaga; and run-ins with prodigal hit makers and managers like Puff Daddy, Russell Simmons, Chris Lighty, Irv Gotti, and Lyor Cohen. Taking the reader behind the smoke-and-mirrors glamour of the hip hop world, so often seen as the only way out for those with few options, Prodigy lays down the truth about the intoxicating power of money, the meaning of true friendship and loyalty, and the ultimately redemptive power of self. This is the heartbreaking journey of a child born in privilege, his youth spent among music royalty like Diana Ross and Dizzy Gillespie, educated in private schools, until a family tragedy changed everything. Raised in the mayhem of the Queensbridge projects, Prodigy rose to the dizzying heights of fame and eventually fell into the darkness of a prison cell. A truly candid memoir, part fearless confessional and part ode to the concrete jungles of New York City, My Infamous Life is written by a man who was on the front line of the last great moment in hip hop history and who is still fighting to achieve his very own American Dream.",1439103186,9781439103180,320,Albert   Johnson,Laura Checkoway, ,3.97,286,29,Touchstone,April 19th 2011,Hardcover,English,330-10330001-my-infamous-life.html

Miller won four league titles and one League Cup with Rangers, but it was a career full of controversy and regrets as well as victories and silverware. Now, in The Proper Charlie , Charlie Miller reveals the real inside story of his incredible life and career, from his upbringing in Castlemilk, one of Glasgow's toughest housing estates, to his unusual family set-up and his feelings on never knowing who his father was. He explains how the gang culture he was involved in almost ended his Rangers career before it had started and speaks openly about the impact drugs, alcohol and gambling have had on his life. Charlie also takes us inside the Ibrox dressing-room, where he mixed with iconic figures like Ally McCoist, Brian Laudrup and Paul Gascoigne, and explains how he went from Rangers hero to rock bottom � with spells at Dundee United and overseas along the way � in an incredible and turbulent few years.

I do not believe there are many hearts so callous, that a little anecdote of cruelty to these helpless creatures will not touch them",, ,0,Miranda Eliot Swan, , ,0.00,0,0,Library of Alexandria,December 27th 2012,Kindle Edition,English,3310-19706962-daisy.html

As he began to distance himself from his shady past, tragedy struck when his young wife died suddenly and, grieving, he spiralled out of control and ended up serving another spell in prison.

Perhaps it was for love, for an end to loneliness, for someone to listen, perhaps for answers to my questions about the meaning of it all. Sometimes that search seemed futile but I was always aware of an elusive something, just out of my grasp, something that every once in a while revealed itself momentarily and kept me searching."" Author Elizabeth Russell's dramatic story speaks of the isolation and longing deep within us that is tempered by an appreciation of the awe-inspiring world in which we live. If being human means being fully engaged in knowing oneself, then ""Reading Under the Covers"" may inspire others who have abandoned the search for self or have never engaged in it. ""Reading Under the Covers"" is intended to generate a conversation that is missing in society today-a conversation about aging that views life as an opportunity not to be squandered, but to be cherished until the end.",0595361684,9780595361687,308,Elizabeth Russell, , ,4.00,1,0,iUniverse,August 9th 2005,Paperback,English,3326-8848535-reading-under-the-covers.html

2617,Killing Time: The Autobiography of Paul Feyerabend,"Killing Time is the story of Paul Feyerabend's life. Finished only weeks before his death in 1994, it is the self-portrait of one of this century's most original and influential intellectuals. Trained in physics and astronomy, Feyerabend was best known as a philosopher of science. But he emphatically was not a builder of theories or a writer of rules. Rather, his fame was in powerful, plain-spoken critiques of ""big"" science and ""big"" philosophy. Feyerabend gave voice to a radically democratic ""epistemological anarchism:"" he argued forcefully that there is not one way to knowledge, but many principled paths; not one truth or one rationality but different, competing pictures of the workings of the world. ""Anything goes,"" he said about the ways of science in his most famous book, Against Method. And he meant it. Here, for the first time, Feyerabend traces the trajectory that led him from an isolated, lower-middle-class childhood in Vienna to the height of international academic success. He writes of his experience in the German army on the Russian front, where three bullets left him crippled, impotent, and in lifelong pain. He recalls his promising talent as an operatic tenor (a lifelong passion), his encounters with everyone from Martin Buber to Bertolt Brecht, innumerable love affairs, four marriages, and a career so rich he once held tenured positions at four universities at the same time. Although not written as an intellectual autobiography, Killing Time sketches the people, ideas, and conflicts of sixty years. Feyerabend writes frankly of complicated relationships with his mentor Karl Popper and his friend and frequent opponent Imre Lakatos, and his reactions to a growing reputation as the ""worst enemy of science.""",0226245322,9780226245324,203,Paul Karl Feyerabend, , ,4.23,130,16,University Of Chicago Press,November 15th 1996,Paperback,English,336-147379.Killing_Time.html

2620,An Autobiography of Lessons Learned,"When Jagannath Giri left India to seek a better future in the United States, he thought his wife and children would join him in short order. Just leaving his homeland was a big step. He had lived there all of his thirty-eight years, but he desperately wanted to further his education--and the best place to do that was in the United States. Even though he arrived in the United States with just $8 in his pocket, he earned a doctoral degree in engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. He became the first man in the world to prove that composite material is lighter and stronger than the conventional aluminum used to make airplanes, and his temporary separation from his family became more permanent when he accepted a job at his alma mater. Giri fought valiantly to get his family visas to join him in the United States, but the paperwork was tedious, and his native country was fighting a ""brain drain."" After nine long years, however, the family was finally reunited.

2628,Forty Years of Murder: An Autobiography,"'Find that whip and you've found your man.' Keith Simpson told the police, pointing to the diamond-pattern weave of the lash marks on the savagely mutilated body of Margery Gardner. The police found the whip in an attache case left in a railway cloakroom by Neville George Cleverly Heath. Another notorious killer, John George Haigh, boasted that the murder of Mrs Durand-Deacon could not be proved without the body, which he though he had totally destroyed in a bath of sulphuric acid. Keith Simpson probed in the gravel where the sludge had been tipped and picked out a stone with polished facets. 'A lucky find,' commented a police officer when laboratory tests confirmed it was a human gallstone. 'I was looking for it,' answered the pathologist. Haigh's victim had suffered from gallstones, which are covered with acid-resistant fat. Keith Simpson's life as Home Office Pathologist is the inside story of forty years of sensational murders, including the cases of the Luton sack murder, the Chalkpit murder, both Heath and Haigh, Hanratty and the A6 murder, the Kray Gang murder at the 'Blind Beggar', and the mystery of Lord Lucan and the murdered nanny. With his acute powers of deduction, aided by an eye for the minutest detail, Professor Simpson has helped to prove the guilt, and sometimes the innocence, of hundreds of people charged with murder. He has also travelled abroad widely, and his overseas cases include the murder of King Ananda of Siam, and a number in a Caribbean including that of Gale Benson, who was executed at the orders of the Black Power leader Michael X.",0586050388,9780586050385,400,Keith Simpson, , ,4.28,88,9,HarperCollins,April 3rd 1980,Paperback,English,337-3518522-forty-years-of-murder.html

These selected paragraphs distill the contents and give you a quick look inside An Autobiography: When I got into touch with some of the members of this group, its transformation into a new school had already been accomplished, so that I found myself confronted by an academy whose aesthetics and dogmas were well established, and had to be accepted or rejected as a whole. ...He told me that before anything else I must continue my studies in harmony and counterpoint with one or other of his pupils in order to acquire complete mastery in the schooling of craftsmanship, but at the same time he strongly advised me not to enter the Conservatoire. ...Although in my ingenuousness I was somewhat downcast over the lack of enthusiasm that the master had shown for my first attempts at composition, I found some comfort in the fact that he had nevertheless advised me to continue my studies, and so demonstrated his opinion that I had sufficient ability to devote myself to a musical career. ...Indeed, every doctrine of aesthetics, when put into practice, demands a particular mode of expression-in fact, a technique of its own; for, in art, such a thing as technique founded on no given basis-in short, a technique in the void-would be utterly inconceivable; and it would be still more difficult to imagine when a whole group, or school, is under consideration. ...It was at this point that I began the close relations with Diaghileff which lasted for twenty years, right up to his death, and developed into a deep friendship based on a reciprocal affection that was proof against the difference of views or tastes which could not but arise from time to time in such a long period.",1486155154,9781486155156,62,Igor Stravinsky, , ,4.00,1,1,Emereo Classics,June 18th 2012,Paperback,English,3379-18732876-an-autobiography---the-original-classic-edition.html

2650,"Augustus Carp, Esq. By Himself Being the Autobiography of a Really Good Man","It is customary, I have noticed, in publishing an autobiography to preface it with some sort of apology. But there are times, and surely the present is one of them, when to do so is manifestly unnecessary. In an age when every standard of decent conduct has either been torn down or is threatened with destruction; when every newspaper is daily reporting scenes of violence, divorce, and arson; when quite young girls smoke cigarettes and even, I am assured, sometimes cigars; when mature women, the mothers of unhappy children, enter the sea in one-piece bathing-costumes; and when married men, the heads of households, prefer the flicker of the cinematograph to the Athanasian Creed -- then it is obviously a task, not to be justifiably avoided, to place some higher example before the world.For some time -- I am now forty-seven -- I had been feeling this with increasing urgency. And when not only my wife and her four sisters, but the vicar of my parish, the Reverend Simeon Whey, approached me with the same suggestion, I felt that delay would amount to sin. That sin, by many persons, is now lightly regarded, I am, of course, only too well aware. That its very existence is denied by others is a fact equally familiar to me. But I am not one of them. On every ground I am an unflinching opponent of sin. I have continually rebuked it in others. I have strictly refrained from it in myself. And for that reason alone I have deemed it incumbent upon me to issue this volume.",1598180355,9781598180350,136,Henry H.

2678,Out in the Open: An Autobiography,"""I was born in a house of books."" So begins this long-awaited autobiography, in which Geoffrey Dutton embarks on an honest, controversial and brilliantly entertaining journey through seventy crowded years. His unusual childhood was dominated by the lavish lives of his wealthy parents who collected houses as well as books, although young Geoffrey was despatched to boarding school at a young age while his mother travelled abroad to enjoy a flirtation with the European aristocracy. His real education came later, in wartime. He joined the air force, and as well as embarking on various amorous adventures, his risky low flying antics had him promptly locked up in the ""boob"". During the war he also began publishing poetry and was closely associated with the modernist movement in art and literature. Later he studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, where C.S. Lewis was one of his tutors. Since then Geoffrey Dutton has become renowned as a poet, critic, biographer, publisher and editor. In this masterpiece of literary autobiography he traces many journeys, from his sojourn in Cold War crazy Kansas to a wild and wonderful visit to Russia as a hapless victim of Intourist. Other travels take him through the Pacific, Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean. There are many intimate portraits of his sometimes volatile friends, among them the feisty Zhenya Yevtushenko, fellow flier David Campbell, Russell Drysdale, Arthur Boyd, Sidney Nolan, the precocious Robert Hughes, Ken Slessor, and Max Harris, eccentric survivor of ""Ern Malley"".

2691,Cheech & Chong: The Unauthorized Autobiography,"Dave's Not Here, ManBut America's favorite stoner comedian, Tommy Chong, is back and funnier than ever as he takes us on a nostalgic trip through his career with partner Richard ""Cheech"" Marin. Over the course of their decades-long partnership, Cheech and Chong performed to sold-out crowds across the country, made nine hit albums, starred in eight blockbuster movies, and created memorable and iconic characters that still resonate with fans today. But the good life didn't just appear in a haze of smoke. It all started during the late 1960s in a strip club in the fragile heart of Vancouver's Chinatown, where Tommy was winding down his career as a Motown recording artist and starting an improv comedy troupe, and Cheech was a draft-dodging, pottery-throwing, underground music reviewer. Together they came to define the hippie-era counterculture, and theircelebrated movie debut, ""Up in Smoke,"" remains one of the highest-grossing Warner Bros. films ever. In his very own unauthorized autobiography, ""New York Times"" bestselling author and pop culture hero Chong reveals his unique relationship with Cheech and recalls the inspiration for their most beloved bits. He introduces famous guest stars like Peter Sellers, John Belushi, Jimi Hendrix, Dan Aykroyd, John Lennon, Diana Ross, and Jack Nicholson, and examines the influences that had the greatest impact on his comedy -- from R&B musicians and Redd Foxx to Lenny Bruce and (of course) marijuana. Finally, with keen insight and utter candor, he explores the rift that has separated the legendary comedy team for more than twenty years. From pot smoking to politics to the universe at large, ""Cheech & Chong: The Unauthorized Autobiography"" is the closestyou'll ever get to sitting in a van made entirely of marijuana, trading stories with an unlikely legend, and feeling...well...funny.",7770799856, ,224,Tommy Chong, , ,4.00,1,0,Simon Spotlight Entertainment,August 12th 2008,ebook, ,3427-18029427-cheech-chong.html

2704,Antonin Raymond: An Autobiography,"As the first architect to synthesize traditional Japanese forms and ideas with the new design philosophy of the West, Antonin Raymond has been a major creative force during a great part of this century. Raymond, as a young graduate architect, had journeyed from his native Bohemia to the United States in search of the new world of architecture heralded by the achievements of Frank Lloyd Wright. He met and worked with Wright at his Taliesin home, but did not find in America the creative milieu he sought. Accompanying Wright to Japan to assist in planning and building the Imperial Hotel, Raymond responded strongly to the beauty of traditional Japanese architecture and art. In 1921, the 32-year-old Raymond began his career as an independent architect in Tokyo, adapting new technologies to the universal principles embodied in Japanese forms. Over the years, he revolutionized the arts of design and construction in Japan and created many works which now rank as milestones of modern architecture. Architecture is not the only medium in which he has distinguished himself; Raymond is an accomplished painter, sculptor and musician. As this book reveals, Raymond has been impelled toward the central events of our century. Serving as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Expeditionary Force in World War I, he was present at the inception of the Czechoslovak nation. Decorated by many governments, he was a Czechoslovak consul in pre-World War II Tokyo. Returning to that city in 1945, he witnessed its painful recovery from the devastation of the war as, earlier, he had witnessed the Great Kanto Earthquake and its aftermath. Fascinating people appear in these pages. Frank Lloyd Wright, a giant presence, is vividly depicted as a warm friend and exacting mentor, a respected colleague and a wrathful adversary. Here, too, are the poet Paul Claude, the composer Igor Stravinsky, painters and architects like Le Corbusier, Fernand Léger, Amédée Ozenfant, Taro Okamoto, Kenzo Tange, and many others. Mrs. Raymond, a distinguished painter and designer, has contributed much to the Raymond style, and her presence enlivens and enriches this account. This book will be absorbing, entertaining reading for anyone interested in the important artistic developments of our century. including 37 color plates, more than 600 black-and-white plates and illustrations, over 100 plans",0804810443,9780804810449,328,Antonin Raymond, , ,4.00,1,0,Tuttle Publishing,1973,Hardcover,English,3439-1391809.Antonin_Raymond.html

These selected paragraphs distill the contents and give you a quick look inside An Autobiography: When I got into touch with some of the members of this group, its transformation into a new school had already been accomplished, so that I found myself confronted by an academy whose aesthetics and dogmas were well established, and had to be accepted or rejected as a whole. ...He told me that before anything else I must continue my studies in harmony and counterpoint with one or other of his pupils in order to acquire complete mastery in the schooling of craftsmanship, but at the same time he strongly advised me not to enter the Conservatoire. ...Although in my ingenuousness I was somewhat downcast over the lack of enthusiasm that the master had shown for my first attempts at composition, I found some comfort in the fact that he had nevertheless advised me to continue my studies, and so demonstrated his opinion that I had sufficient ability to devote myself to a musical career. ...Indeed, every doctrine of aesthetics, when put into practice, demands a particular mode of expression-in fact, a technique of its own; for, in art, such a thing as technique founded on no given basis-in short, a technique in the void-would be utterly inconceivable; and it would be still more difficult to imagine when a whole group, or school, is under consideration. ...It was at this point that I began the close relations with Diaghileff which lasted for twenty years, right up to his death, and developed into a deep friendship based on a reciprocal affection that was proof against the difference of views or tastes which could not but arise from time to time in such a long period.",1486155154,9781486155156,62,Igor Stravinsky, , ,4.00,1,1,Emereo Classics,June 18th 2012,Paperback,English,3452-18732876-an-autobiography---the-original-classic-edition.html

At age 13, in 1861 he volunteered to fight for the Confederacy in the American Civil War. His first military exploit was on the passenger steamer Morgan where he made a trip into the Gulf of Mexico and intercepted and assisted in the capture of General David E.

He became a Radical Republican and pushed for equal rights for blacks, in a newspaper called The Spectator which he published. Later he became the editor of the radical journal the Alarm.

2731,Done in Oil: An Autobiography,"Few individuals have experienced as many facets of the oil industry or known as many of its important characters as J. Howard Marshall II. This autobiography details Marshall’s career, from his days as a young law student writing about the problems of the oil industry for a prestigious law review, to his oil regulation days under FDR, to his work in some of the country’s most important oil companies. In 1931, Marshall began his career on the “outside” of the industry investigating the legality of oil proration in articles for the Yale Law Review . In 1933, Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes persuaded him to go to work for the government, which was then attempting to curtail petroleum overproduction. No longer an outsider, Marshall coauthored the Code of Fair Competition for the Oil Industry in 1933 and drafted the Connally Hot Oil Act of 1935, the California State Lands Act of 1938, the Cole Pipeline Act of 1941, and the executive order creating the National Petroleum Council in 1946. Marshall’s role as co-founder and chief counsel for the Petroleum Administration for War (PAW) in the early 1940s proved pivotal to coordinating the industry during wartime. After World War II, Marshall worked for various oil-industry corporations. His list of associations and directorships demonstrates his long-term dedication to the industry. Marshall’s entertaining and detailed memories bring to life many of the most famous public and private characters of oil history. Unlike any work before it, Done in Oil recounts the history of the oil industry from the perspective of an individual who has known it, quite literally, inside-out, both as practitioner and as analyst. From the curious to the student of oil, business, and government history, readers will come away from this book having learned something new and significant about the oil industry and its culture.",0890969876,9780890969878,304,J.

2733,An Autobiography of Jack London,"Jack London has been a best-selling author for more than one hundred years. In his short life (1876–1916) he wrote twenty-five novels and dozens of short stories, plays, and essays. Today he is recognized as a forerunner of such literary giants as Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, and Jack Kerouac. Author of a number of well-known and well-loved stories in our literature (including White Fang, The Call of the Wild , and The Sea Wolf ), London also worked as a day laborer, Alaskan gold rusher, and seaman. He was also an adventurer, journalist, celebrity, polemicist, and drunk. An Autobiography of Jack London is a revealing portrait of the man who was Jack London—in his own words—and is largely composed of excerpts from his memoirs: The Road, John Barleycorn , and The Cruise of the Snark . Rather than a mere biographical summary of a man’s life, An Autobiography of Jack London aims to give the reader real insight into the character and personality of this uniquely American literary icon.

2734,Calling The Horses: A Racing Autobiography,"For decades, Peter O'Sullevan was one of the iconic sports commentators, providing the soundtrack for half a century of horseracing as he called home such legends of the sport as Arkle, Nijinsky, Red Rum, and Desert Orchid. His rapid-fire commentary seemed to echo the sound of horses' hooves, and it was not long before he became known as ""The Voice of Racing."" But in addition to his legendary status as a TV personality, Peter O'Sullevan was also a notable journalist and much-admired writer, and it is a measure of his standing both within and beyond the world of racing that his compulsively readable autobiography, first published in 1989 and reprinted eight times, reached the top of the Sunday Times non-fiction bestseller list. The most recent edition has brought many fresh episodes in the ongoing Peter O'Sullevan story, including the last racing days of his great friend Lester Piggott in 1995, his commentary on the ""Bomb Scare"" Grand National of 1997, and his retirement from the BBC. He also describes setting up the Sir Peter O'Sullevan Charitable Trust, which has raised over £3.5 million for animal welfare charities, as well as offering his appreciation of a new generation of racing heroes, including jockey AP McCoy, who has come to dominate jump racing in a manner unparalleled in any sport, and the wonder-horse Frankel. The heartening news for the legions of Peter O'Sullevan fans is that, despite his years, his enthusiasm for racing is undiminished, and so are the elegance, fluency, and wit which infuse his writing style. This new and extensively updated edition is a very remarkable book by a very remarkable man.",1473606861,9781473606869,336,Sir Peter O'Sullevan, , ,5.00,1,0,Hodder & Stoughton,January 1st 2015,Hardcover, ,3466-23493423-calling-the-horses.html

After leaving school at 14, he started his career as a greengrocer at the New Covent Garden market, and went on to create his multi-million pound fruit and veg business a decade later. A star slot on BBC Veg Talk and an award-winning television program followed, and, in 2005, the chance to front Masterchef , a show that has drawn in over 4.5 million viewers and produced some of the nation's best up-and-coming chefs. He has since opened two restaurants, Wallace & Co and Gregg's Table, penned numerous cookery books, and has written for the national and trade press. In this, his first memoir, Gregg tells how his early passion for food growing up in Peckham, south London, led to a world of Michelin star restaurants, celebrity chefs, and a mission to save Britain's produce and, in an extraordinary turn with more than a few life-changing hurdles, brought him back to his roots.",1409139212,9781409139218,320,Greg Wallace, , ,4.00,1,1,Orion Publishing,February 1st 2014,Paperback,English,3467-18595796-life-on-a-plate.html

2737,Threads of Life: Autobiography and the Will,"Many autobiographers share profound questions about human life with their readers—questions like: To what extent was my life imposed on me? To what extent did I bring it about through particular choices and actions, through the activity of my own will? Indeed, the issue of the will is central to autobiographical writing, and some of the greatest autobiographies give extended consideration to the will—its nature; its powers; its limitations; the forms of freedom, constraint, and expression it finds in various cultures; its role in particular human lives. In this new study, unprecedented in subject and scope, Richard Freadman offers the first sustained account of how changing theological, philosophical, and psychological accounts of the human will have been reflected in the writing of autobiography, and of how autobiography in its turn has helped shape various understandings of the will. Early chapters trace narrative representations of the will from antiquity (the Greeks and Augustine) to postmodernism (Derrida and Barthes), with particular emphasis on late modernity's culture of the will. Later chapters then present detailed and powerfully original readings of autobiographical texts by Louis Althusser, Roland Barthes, B. F. Skinner, Ernest Hemingway, Simone de Beauvoir, Arthur Koestler, Stephen Spender, and Diana Trilling. Freadman's interdisciplinary approach to autobiography and the will includes a theoretical defense of the view that autobiographers are, in varying degrees, agents in their own texts. Threads of Life argues that late modernity has inherited deeply conflicted attitudes to the will. Freadman suggests that these attitudes, now deeply embedded in contemporary cultural discourse, need reexamining. In this, he contends, 'reflective autobiography' has an important part to play.",0226261433,9780226261430,394,Richard Freadman, , ,0.00,0,0,University Of Chicago Press,February 1st 2001,Paperback,English,3469-13209954-threads-of-life.html

So when he needed a player to further improve the side that had just won the 1968 European Cup, he set his sights on someone special. That player was Willie Morgan. Sir Matt broke the British transfer record to bring Morgan to Old Trafford, moving George Best over to the left wing to accommodate Willie on the right wing and giving him the mythical number 7 shirt previously worn by the inimitable Best. An instant hit with the Old Trafford crowd, Morgan became a terrace idol in his own right. He was the first player in the world to have his own fan club and was twice voted player of the season in a team of bona fide football legends, including Denis Law and Bobby Charlton. But how did a miner's son from a small village in Scotland make his way to the pinnacle of the football world, while striking up lasting friendships with show-business celebrities such as Tom Jones, Rod Stewart and Johnny Mathis off the field? In On the Wing , Willie Morgan entertainingly recounts his remarkable journey in life and football.",1780577613,9781780577616,0,Willie Morgan,Simon Wadsworth, ,0.00,0,0,Mainstream Digital,August 1st 2013,ebook, ,3472-17614876-on-the-wing.html

2749,The Autobiography of Fidel Castro,"An audacious “biography” of the ex-president of Cuba told in Castro’s own outrageous, bombastic voice. Prize-winning author and journalist Norberto Fuentes was once a revolutionary: a writer with privileged access to Fidel Castro’s inner circle during some the most challenging years of the revolution. But in the late 1990s, as the regime began sending its oldest comrades to the firing squad, he became A Man Who Knew Too Much. Escaping a death sentence and now living in exile, Fuentes has written a brilliant, satirical, and utterly captivating “autobiography” of the Cuban leader—in Fidel’s own arrogant and seductive language—discussing everything from Castro’s early sexual experiences in Birán to his true feelings about Che Guevara and his philosophy on murder, legacy, and state secrets. Critics have long admired Fuentes’s writing; one U.S. article called him “Norman Mailer’s Cuban pen pal.” Akin to Gertrude Stein’s The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, or Edmund Morris’s Dutch , this wickedly entertaining, true-to-life masterpiece is as imaginative and outsized as Castro himself.",0393068994,9780393068993,567,Norberto Fuentes,Anna Kushner, ,3.58,65,10,W.

2751,Dickie Bird Autobiography,"Dickie Bird's retirement was an international event shown on TV screens and newspapers throughout the world. He is a household name, an eccentric, and one of the most loved and respected characters in world cricket. His idiosyncratic style and infectious humour has endeared him to millions, transcending his sport. Fiercely proud of his background as a Yorkshire miner's son, his account follows his youth in Barnsley, his early days as a cricketer, through to his career as an umpire and his experiences of the international scene, all told with total honesty by this very private person. As the most respected umpire in the game, Dickie has serious and constructive points to make about modern cricket. He has fearlessly berated fast-bowlers when necessary. He has some sharp comments to make about ball tampering and he has mixed feelings about the introduction of the third umpire. Dickie wanted to go out at the top and he has certainly done so - after standing at 66 Test matches, three World Cup finals and 92 one-day Internationals. Combining forthright views on the game and those involved in it, compelling accounts of what it is like behind the scenes in cricket at the highest level, and the hilarious stories for which Dickie is so well known, here is the refreshing and enjoyable autobiography of a sporting legend.",, ,528,Dickie Bird,Michael Parkinson, ,5.00,1,0,Hodder & Stoughton,August 16th 2012,Kindle Edition,,3481-20141938-dickie-bird-autobiography.html

2754,The Winning Touch: My Autobiography,"In this definitive autobiography and document of Celtic's greatest era, Lisbon Lion Stevie Chalmers tells his life story for the first time and reveals aspects of his extraordinary career and life story that he has never previously made public One of Celtic's greatest ever strikers, Stevie Chalmers epitomized the exciting attacking football with which Celtic took Europe by storm during the 1960s. He scored the golden goal in the 1967 European Cup final that clinched the great trophy for Celtic and that saw him and his teammates immortalized as the Lisbon Lions. Stevie was the Glasgow club's leading scorer in that amazing 1966-67 season, when they became the first British club to reign as champions of Europe and in which they scooped up every trophy at home. He was also the club's most prolific striker during the 1960s, becoming leading goalscorer for Celtic four times during that decade. It was appropriate, then, that it should be Stevie Chalmers who should nip in ahead of everyone five minutes from time in Lisbon to finish off, with finesse, the challenge of Internazionale of Milan, the richest and most successful club in the world. It was the most magical moment in Celtic's history and Stevie describes here, in fascinating detail, just how he came to be in the right place at the right time to write himself into history. Here for the first time Stevie relates key inside details of Celtic's path to glory, his own enormous personal battle to overcome a near-fatal illness to become a footballer, and his sometimes uneasy relationship with Jock Stein, the Celtic manager. It all underlines the momentousness of his being there to accomplish that match-winning feat on Celtic's greatest-ever day.",0755363248,9780755363247,288,Stevie Chalmers,Graham McColl, ,3.50,2,0,Headline Book Publishing,August 1st 2013,Paperback, ,3484-16087130-the-winning-touch.html

Chapters are arranged in chronological order and are grouped to reflect changing views of the psychological status, representative character, and moral authority of the autobiographical text. The volume closes with a group portrait of late-modernist and contemporary autobiographies that, by blurring the dividing line between fiction and non-fiction, expand our understanding of the genre.

In this highly entertaining memoir, Jenkins gives an insight into the creative process behind the music that has touched so many across the globe.

Then, in the 1980s, he achieved huge success in the world of advertising, composing for brands such as Levi’s, BA, Renault, Volvo, De Beers, Tag Heuer, and Pepsi. But it was in 1994 that his immensely successful project Adiemus: Songs of Sanctuary propelled him to international stardom. Combining a classical music style with an invented language, ethnic vocals, and percussion, the composition struck a chord with listeners the world over, reaching the top of the charts in many countries. Jenkins has since gone from strength to strength, forming a huge international following.

Bok wrote of his eventful life, ""Every life has some interest and significance; mine, perhaps, a special one. Here was a little Dutch boy unceremoniously set down in America unable to make himself understood or even to know what persons were saying; his education was extremely limited, practically negligible; and yet, by curious decree of fate, he was destined to write, for a period of years, to the largest body of readers ever addressed by an American editor. . . ."" Perhaps Bok's success was due to his willingness to champion progressive causes to the wide readership of The Ladies Home Journal. Bok advocated women's suffrage, saving the environment, public sex education, education on prenatal care and children's health, and pacifism. EDWARD BOK (1863-1930), American Pulitzer Prize-winning author, was born in Den Helder, The Netherlands, and came to the United States in 1869. He edited The Ladies Home Journal for 30 years. During that time, it became the first magazine to reach one million subscribers. Bok also wrote books such as Successward and America Give Me a Chance.

2772,Autobiography and National Identity in the Americas Autobiography and National Identity in the Americas,"AUTOBIOGRAPHY AND NATIONAL IDENTITY in the Americas puts texts from English and French Canada, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Brazil, Bolivia, and the United States into a hemispheric dialogue on national and ethnic identity. Drawing on such materials as journals, personal essays, autobiography, and the testimonio, this ambitious book is as comprehensive in its treatment of autobiographical writing as in its geographical coverage. Departing from Benedict Anderson's hopeful premise that the ""imagined community"" is fundamentally inclusive, Steven V. Hunsaker maintains that national identity is more idiosyncratic, complex, and divisive than Anderson's model suggests. The fact that potential compatriots create the nation by seeing themselves as a community means that there can be no guarantee of uniformly imagined identity. Hunsaker uses works by such authors as Rigoberta Menchu, Carolina Maria de Jesus, Pierre Vallieres, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Richard Rodriguez to illustrate how different populations within a single nation--children, women, indigenous groups, and minority groups--challenge established collective identities and create their own senses of community.

Indeed, the rise of writing about the self is an important indicator of the transition from the culture of the Enlightenment to that of Romanticism. Arguing that Rousseau and Goethe are the foremost practitioners of Romantic autobiography, Eugene L. Stelzig offers the first comparative study of these foundational figures. Although the term 'Romantic autobiography' has been in use for some years, there has been no developed critical or generic discussion of it, nor of Rousseau's, Goethe's, and Wordsworth's writings as the leading examples of the genre. Stelzig provides an overview of how these authors fashioned a distinctive type of self-writing at the historical moment when modern autobiography emerged in its identifiable form. Within this historical and critical context, Stelzig analyzes in depth Rousseau's and Goethe's conceptions of the genre and their autobiographical output, merging close critical reading of selected episodes with psychobiographical analysis. He shows how both writers' presentations of their relationships with others are at times defensive and self-seeking and indicate a truth more complex and ambiguous than they are willing to acknowledge. In particular, Stelzig demonstrates how Goethe exploited the resources of fiction to emphasize and highlight the subjective and personal in his work, a practice Rousseau engaged in only covertly. Stelzig analyzes the major episodes of Rousseau's Confessions in light of his philosophical writings and the biographical record and offers a revisionary reading of his brilliant but largely unknown Dialogues. Stelzig's chapters on Goethe's monumental portrait of his early years, Poetry and Truth, constitute the fullest critical discussion extant of Goethe's ambitious project and of the ideal of Bildung (education, development) that informs his life narrative. Stelzig concludes with a discussion of Goethe's presentation of his complex relationship with his parents and sister and the romantic involvements that play such a prominent role in his autobiography and in the public legend of his life.",0813919754,9780813919751,279,Eugene L.

2776,From Annapolis to Scapa Flow: The Autobiography of Edward L. Beach Sr.,"""Fans of Edward L. Beach Jr.'s books, including his submarine novel Run Silent, Run Deep and his history of the U.S. Navy, will be drawn to this memoir by his father, a popular novelist of his era. Not only was Beach Sr. a good story-teller but he was also an astute observer of history in the making, and his naval career spanned the sailing and steam navies. Written in the 1930s but never before published, this book is as much about the U.S. Navy as it is about Beach. In his early days Beach served with Civil War veterans aboard wooden ships, while late in his service his shipmates were the future naval leaders of World War II. His firsthand accounts of the Battle of Manila Bay in 1898, insurrection in Haiti in 1915, and Scapa Flow in 1918 provide the kind of details that bring readers into the conflict. His recounting of the wreck of the Memphis, a cruiser under Beach's command that was destroyed in 1916 by a tsunami in Santo Domingo Harbor, is eyewitness reporting at its best."" As Beach describes the growth of the Navy from the 1880s, when the modern Navy had its beginning, to the end of World War I, when it was on its way to becoming the most powerful naval force on earth, he tells not only what happened but how and why. Beach Jr. puts his father's writing in historical context for today's readers, and in some cases offers insights into his father's feelings, such as the elder Beach's sympathies for the Filipinos and later for the Haitians when the U.S. Navy intervened in their countries. Rarely does a valuable primary source like this come to light so many years after it has been written.",1557502986,9781557502988,302,Edward L. Beach Sr.,Edward L.

By the time of her death in 1915 the church had conceded to women the positions of congregational stewardess, conference evangelist, and denominational deaconess.

2779,The Substance and the Shadow: An Autobiography,"An authentic, heartfelt and compelling narrative – straight from the horse’s mouth – that reveals for the first time numerous unknown aspects of the life and times of one of the greatest legends of all time who stands out as a symbol of secular India. Dilip Kumar (born as Yousuf Khan), who began as a diffident novice in Hindi cinema in the early 1940s, went on to attain the pinnacle of stardom within a short time. He came up with spellbinding performances in one hit film after another – in his almost six-decade-long career – on the basis of his innovative capability, determination, hard work and never-say-die attitude. In this unique volume, Dilip Kumar traces his journey right from his birth to the present. In the process, he candidly recounts his interactions and relationships with a wide variety of people not only from his family and the film fraternity but also from other walks of life, including politicians. While seeking to set the record straight, as he feels that a lot of what has been written about him so far is ‘full of distortions and misinformation’, he narrates, in graphic detail, how he got married to Saira Banu, which reads like a fairy tale! Dilip Kumar relates, matter-of-factly, the event that changed his life: his meeting with Devika Rani, the boss of Bombay Talkies, when she offered him an acting job. His first film was Jwar Bhata (1944). He details how he had to learn everything from scratch and how he had to develop his own distinct histrionics and style, which would set him apart from his contemporaries. After that, he soon soared to great heights with movies such as Jugnu, Shaheed, Mela, Andaz, Deedar, Daag and Devdas. In these movies he played the tragedian with such intensity that his psyche was adversely affected. He consulted a British psychiatrist, who advised him to switch over to comedy. The result was spectacular performances in laugh riots such as Azaad and Kohinoor, apart from a scintillating portrayal as a gritty tonga driver in Naya Daur. After a five-year break he started his ‘second innings’ with Kranti (1981), after which he appeared in a series of hits such as Vidhaata, Shakti, Mashaal, Karma, Saudagar and Qila.",9381398860,9789381398869,450,Dilip Kumar, , ,3.58,96,14,Hay House India,June 8th 2014,Hardcover,English,3507-22560445-the-substance-and-the-shadow.html

The first African American graduate of West Point, he served four years in the West as a cavalry officer but was court-martialed and dismissed from the service in 1882. He spent the rest of his long life attempting to clear his name.Flipper’s record of accomplishment was significant for any individual in any time, and for a nineteenth-century black American it was phenomenal. As historian Quintard Taylor points out, in his post-Army career Flipper was a surveyor, cartographer, civil and mining engineer, interpreter, translator, historian, inventor, newspaper editor, special agent for the Justice Department, deputy U.S. mineral surveyor, aide to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and consultant to the secretary of the interior. His work carried him to Mexico, Venezuela, and Spain, and he left a record of achievement that demonstrates his enormous talent and unrelenting effort.

2784,Give me this mountain: an autobiography,"'Give Me This Mountain' is the British title of the autobiography of Dr. Helen Roseveare, graduate in medicine from University of Cambridge, in the late 1940's. A wellknown missionary doctor and author, with several of her works still in print, she worked in the northeastern province of the Belgian Congo with the Heart of Africa Mission in the 1950's & 60's. She established a substantial pioneer medical service and assisted the churches before Congo's independence in 1960, and continued there for some years after, at a time when many had to flee for their lives. Helen tells her story in down to earth terms, from playing cricket for the ladies' university side (a liberated woman even then), to her return to Britain after five months as a hostage in rebel terrorist hands. Her candid account is an antidote to any delusion that missionaries are saints who float about an inch off the ground and see a blinding light from heaven when they receive 'the call'. She almost failed in missionary school through her personal failings. Her own admitted stubbornness, pride, knowitall attitude and inability to work with others made her a liability. The final decision to send her overseas came when an incident with a broken washing line proved that she at least had a sense of humour in the face of adversity! Physical dangers and her personal ambition in the Congo often almost sank her, but her faith and hard work brought her through. Her story is one of bright mountains, conquered after experiencing the dark valleys and learning to give the glory to God.",0851103340,9780851103341,160,Helen Roseveare, , ,4.27,88,9,Inter-Varsity,July 1966, , ,3511-2185026.Give_me_this_mountain.html

Marita Golden was raised in Washington, D.C., by a mother who was a cleaning woman and a father who was taxi-driver. For all their struggles, with life and each other, her parents instilled her with spirit and aspirations. Swept up in the heady Black Power movement of the sixties, Marita moved to New York to study journalism at Columbia--and fell in love with Femi Ajayi, a Nigerian architecture student.. Their passion led them to start a life together in Africa--a place Marita was eager to understand. Exhilarated by a world free of white racism, Marita quickly found work as a professor and embraced motherhood. But Femi's increasing expectations that she snap into the role of the submissive Nigerian wife were shocking and dispiriting. Her struggle to regain her footing and shape a black identity that was true to her spirit is suspenseful and inspiring, an uncommon tale of race, identity, and Africa.",1400078318,9781400078318,240,Marita Golden, , ,4.17,89,8,Anchor,January 4th 2005,Paperback,English,3512-587847.Migrations_of_the_Heart.html

2789,Light Writing and Life Writing: Photography in Autobiography,"On the surface, the use of photography in autobiography appears to have a straightforward purpose: to illustrate and corroborate the text. But in the wake of poststructuralism, the role of photography in autobiography is far from simple or one-dimensional. Both media are increasingly self-conscious, argues Timothy Adams, and combining them intensifies rather than reduces the complexity and ambiguity of each taken separately. Focusing on works by Paul Auster, Maxine Hong Kingston, Sheila Ortiz Taylor, Sandra Ortiz Taylor, N. Scott Momaday, Michael Ondaatje, Reynolds Price, Eudora Welty, Wright Morris, and Edward Weston, Adams explores the ways in which text and image can interact with and reflect on one another. Photography may stimulate, inspire, or seem to document autobiography, he demonstrates, but it may also confound verbal narrative. Conversely, autobiography may mediate, motivate, or even take the form of photography. Because both media exist on the border between fact and fiction, Adams argues, they often undercut just as easily as they reinforce each other. Exploring the interrelations between photography and autobiography uncovers an inherent tendency in both to conceal as much as they reveal.",0807847925,9780807847923,328,Timothy Dow Adams, , ,5.00,1,0,University of North Carolina Press,November 29th 1999,Paperback,English,3516-507964.Light_Writing_and_Life_Writing.html

2803,A Life Against the Grain: The Autobiography of an Unconventional Economist,"In his long and distinguished career as a writer and scholar Julian Simon came to be known as one of the leading--and most controversial--authorities on population economics. An immensely productive writer, his work is unified by a basic core belief: that human intellect and ingenuity are ever-renewable resources in the use and preservation of natural resources. Inevitably, Simon's position provoked the hostility of doctrinaire environmentalists, both in academia and in the movement at large. However, Simon's arguments were invariably built from facts and powerful evidence that stood him well in many high-profile public debates. The first part of Simon's autobiography takes the reader through his childhood, his years as a midshipman and then as an officer in the Navy, plus a stint in the Marines, and his experiences as a copywriter in an advertising firm. Simon's plan after receiving his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago was to be an entrepreneur, which would afford him enough money to care for his parents and allow him free time for writing fiction. He ran a small mail-order business for two years, during which time he wrote his first book, ""How to Start and Operate a Mailorder Business, ""which has since gone through seven editions. Deciding to seek a professional career, in 1963, he accepted a position at the University of Illinois. Although he spent thirty-five years of his life as a faculty member at three universities, his autobiography contains almost no discussion of departmental affairs or university politics, topics about which Simon had little or no interest. Rather, after the personal chronology and experiences, the book includes substantive chapters on research methods, population economics, and immigration. It also explains how Julian Simon became the economist he was. He analyzes crucial periods in his life when he developed his ideas on fundamental issues. Written in an engaging and amusing manner, Julian Simon's autobiography is a combination of personal memoir and professional contribution to important ideas in economics, research methods, and demography.

2806,Once a Blue Always a Blue: The Autobiography of Richard Edghill,"Richard Edghill made his Premiership debut at 17 and was soon an England Under-21 international. A pacy defender who could play anywhere across the back four, he caught the eye of England manager Terry Venables; but a devastating knee injury then sidelined him for 21 months, by which time his beloved Manchester City were headed for the third division. Rather than jump ship Edghill stayed to lead the revival back to the Premiership. With three promotions and three relegations at City, serving under nine managers and three different chairmen, the ups and downs of Richard's rollercoaster career will strike a chord with any City fan who went through similar agonies and ecstasies. A scapegoat, a dreamer, a fiercely loyal Premier League star: although Richard never enjoyed the huge salaries or adulation of some of his colleagues, Once a Blue, Always a Blue presents an overwhelmingly human story.",, ,0,Richard Edghill,Dante Friend, ,3.67,3,0,Pitch Publishing,July 30th 2014,Kindle Edition,English,3531-23299563-once-a-blue-always-a-blue.html

When she was growing up during the 1940s very few people were aware that Jill Allen-King had lost an eye as a baby. However, when tragedy struck for the second time and Jill went completely blind on, what should have been, one of the happiest occasions of her life her wedding day, she was rendered housebound. For seven years, Jill barely left the house, too scared to go outside unless she was taken by her husband and family.

2812,Light Writing and Life Writing: Photography in Autobiography,"On the surface, the use of photography in autobiography appears to have a straightforward purpose: to illustrate and corroborate the text. But in the wake of poststructuralism, the role of photography in autobiography is far from simple or one-dimensional. Both media are increasingly self-conscious, argues Timothy Adams, and combining them intensifies rather than reduces the complexity and ambiguity of each taken separately. Focusing on works by Paul Auster, Maxine Hong Kingston, Sheila Ortiz Taylor, Sandra Ortiz Taylor, N. Scott Momaday, Michael Ondaatje, Reynolds Price, Eudora Welty, Wright Morris, and Edward Weston, Adams explores the ways in which text and image can interact with and reflect on one another. Photography may stimulate, inspire, or seem to document autobiography, he demonstrates, but it may also confound verbal narrative. Conversely, autobiography may mediate, motivate, or even take the form of photography. Because both media exist on the border between fact and fiction, Adams argues, they often undercut just as easily as they reinforce each other. Exploring the interrelations between photography and autobiography uncovers an inherent tendency in both to conceal as much as they reveal.",0807847925,9780807847923,328,Timothy Dow Adams, , ,5.00,1,0,University of North Carolina Press,November 29th 1999,Paperback,English,3537-507964.Light_Writing_and_Life_Writing.html

2816,Holy Boldness: Women Preachers' Autobiographies And The Sanctified Self,"From its inception in the nineteenth century, the Wesleyan/Holiness religious tradition has offered an alternative construction of gender and supported the equality of the sexes. In Holy Boldness, Susie C. Stanley provides a comprehensive analysis of spiritual autobiographies by thirty-four American Wesleyan/Holiness women preachers, published between the mid-nineteenth and mid-twentieth centuries. While a few of these women, primarily African Americans, have been added to the canon of American women's autobiography, Stanley argues for the expansion of the canon to incorporate the majority of the women in her study. She reveals how these empowered women carried out public ministries on behalf of evangelism and social justice. The defining doctrine of the Wesleyan/Holiness tradition is the belief in sanctification, or experiencing a state of holiness. Stanley's analysis illuminates how the concept of the sanctified self inspired women to break out of the narrow confines of the traditional ""women's sphere"" and engage in public ministries, from preaching at camp meetings and revivals to ministering in prisons and tenements. Moreover, as a result of the Wesleyan/Holiness emphasis on experience as a valid source of theology, many women preachers turned to autobiography as a way to share their spiritual quest and religiously motivated activities with others. In such writings, these preachers focused on the events that shaped their spiritual growth and their calling to ministry, often giving only the barest details of their personal lives. Thus, Holy Boldness is not a collective biography of these women but rather an exploration of how sanctification influenced their evangelistic and social ministries. Using the tools of feminist theory and autobiographical analysis in addition to historical and theological interpretation, Stanley traces a trajectory of Christian women's autobiographies and introduces many previously unknown spiritual autobiographies that will expand our understanding of Christian spirituality in nineteenth- and twentieth-century America. The Author: Susie C. Stanley is professor of historical theology at Messiah College. She is the author of Feminist Pillar of Fire: The Life of Alma White.",1572333103,9781572333109,304,Susie C.

2817,A Life Against the Grain: The Autobiography of an Unconventional Economist,"In his long and distinguished career as a writer and scholar Julian Simon came to be known as one of the leading--and most controversial--authorities on population economics. An immensely productive writer, his work is unified by a basic core belief: that human intellect and ingenuity are ever-renewable resources in the use and preservation of natural resources. Inevitably, Simon's position provoked the hostility of doctrinaire environmentalists, both in academia and in the movement at large. However, Simon's arguments were invariably built from facts and powerful evidence that stood him well in many high-profile public debates. The first part of Simon's autobiography takes the reader through his childhood, his years as a midshipman and then as an officer in the Navy, plus a stint in the Marines, and his experiences as a copywriter in an advertising firm. Simon's plan after receiving his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago was to be an entrepreneur, which would afford him enough money to care for his parents and allow him free time for writing fiction. He ran a small mail-order business for two years, during which time he wrote his first book, ""How to Start and Operate a Mailorder Business, ""which has since gone through seven editions. Deciding to seek a professional career, in 1963, he accepted a position at the University of Illinois. Although he spent thirty-five years of his life as a faculty member at three universities, his autobiography contains almost no discussion of departmental affairs or university politics, topics about which Simon had little or no interest. Rather, after the personal chronology and experiences, the book includes substantive chapters on research methods, population economics, and immigration. It also explains how Julian Simon became the economist he was. He analyzes crucial periods in his life when he developed his ideas on fundamental issues. Written in an engaging and amusing manner, Julian Simon's autobiography is a combination of personal memoir and professional contribution to important ideas in economics, research methods, and demography. His observations and personal reflections will interest the general reader on a humanitarian level as well as environmentalists, sociologists, and economists on a professional level.",0765805324,9780765805324,359,Julian Simon, , ,3.00,2,0,Transaction Publishers,September 1st 2003,Paperback,English,3541-555652.A_Life_Against_the_Grain.html

2819,A Sounding of Women: Autobiographies from Unexpected Places,"KEY BENEFIT: So often it is difficult to find a collection of autobiographical stories from uniquely different women of varied cultures. Generally, women's stories are untold, unheard, or unrecorded; however, no more elegant tool exists to describe the human condition than narrative. Written by an anthropologist who designed the first official Women's Studies course in Louisiana, this book has been fueled by the explosion of fascinating research on women since the 1970s. ""Collected Wisdom"" explores and validates the experiences of women around the world through the autobiographical stories of seven women from different cultures. The author has taken each of these stories, put them into perspective, and related them to larger themes and issues.

2820,Blindness & Autobiography: Al-Ayyam of Taha Husayn,"The three-volume life-story of the Egyptian intellectual Tahah Husayn (1889-1973) is a landmark in modern autobiography, in Arabic letters, and in the literature of blindness. This justly celebrated text, however, has never been subjected to the sustained literary analysis here presented by Fedwa Malti-Douglas. Born into a modest family and blinded in childhood, Husayn nevertheless conquered first his own and then a European educational system to become one of his country's leading modernizers. Professor Malti-Douglas shows that the personal, social, and literary reality of the hero's blindness gives the autobiography its unity and force. Blindness and Autobiography is not only a rich explication of al-Ayyam but a pioneering study of the interaction between a severe physical handicap and the autobiographical process. It adds a new perspective to the contemporary discussion of the cultural uses of the body. The first part of the book explores blindness and society, from the evolving conflict between personal and social conceptions of the handicap to the way blindness redefines the more familiar issues of traditional versus modern, East versus West. The second section examines the relationship of blindness to the autobiography's ecriture, rhetoric, and narration. Originally published in 1988.

Helen Corke has a gift for recounting the development of her own consciousness and her personality is revealed through this record of instinctive as well as of objective experience. Born into a Kentish middle-class family which was interested both in literature and trade, she was moved from town to country and back to a London suburb as her father's grocery business first prospered and then abruptly failed. Years of extreme poverty followed. For a gifted girl in such circumstances the only hope of further education was apprenticeship as an elementary school teacher.

2824,Hermann Hesse's Fictions of the Self: Autobiography and the Confessional Imagination,"This masterful synthesis of criticism and biography surveys all of Hermann Hesse's major works and many of his minor ones in relation to the intricate psychological design of his entire life history. Eugene Stelzig examines what it means to be an ""autobiographical writer"" by considering Hesse's fictions of the self as an exemplary instance of the relationship between life and art and between biography and autobiography. In a graceful and inviting style, he frees this major confessional writer from the confines of German culture and the status of ""cult figure"" of the 1960s, and situates him in the tradition of world literature and in a variety of literary, psychological, philosophical, and religious contexts. Three introductory chapters on autobiography and Hesse set the stage for a chronological study. Then follows a penetrating analysis of the balance between biographical fact and confessional fantasy in Hesse's long career, from the failed autobiography of his first literary success, Beneath the Wheel, through the protracted midlife crisis of the grotesque Steppenwolf period, to the visionary autobiography of his magisterial fictional finale, The Glass Bead Game.

Challenging the stereotype that gay men are incapable of lasting and successful relationships, 15 long-term gay couples share slices of their own lives to give you insight into their present relationships, while some discuss life after their mates have passed on. You will find that their stories offer an inspirational and richly fulfilling alternative to an empty life of promiscuity that lacks true love.

A celebration of gay diversity, this book offers you insights from contributors of different ages, professions, geographic locations, and attitudes. You will learn the intimate details of the couples' lives, including: * how they met their partners * how soon they committed to each other * how long the couples have been together--from 14 years to over 50 years * their keys to leading successful, happy lives * the ways in which their relationships fulfill their personal needs and contribute to community life You will come to realize the true strength of these men's relationships as you share in their struggles within a society that offers them little recognition or support for their successful relationships. Co-editor Alfred Lees explains in the introduction to Longtime Companions, ""We've all worked diligently to make our partnerships sound, nurturing, and enduring. We've done this without any social motivation, largely without role models, in the face of 'official' disapproval or contempt.

2836,Pilgrim of the Heavenly Way: The Autobiography of Daniel Smith Christian Missionary to Asia,"DANIEL SMITH was a very average boy born to ordinary Scottish parents in 1907. But at the age of eighteen this shy descendant of the Scottish Covenanters was converted to Christ. Despite naturally being of little account, and certainly not possessing any innate talent for the task, the Lord Jesus Christ fitted him for service and gave him the great honor of taking the Gospel of God all around the world. As a missionary in the northeast portion of China’s Yunnan province during the time surrounding the Communist takeover of that region, he took part in a mighty saving work of God among the Nosu tribes. Later he worked in Sri Lanka and India before ministering for some years in the West, and finally exercising an itinerant ministry in churches around the world. Though the book is an autobiography, Dan’s emphasis is not so much to tell the reader about himself and his life, but to humbly relate the many things God has done for him and through him, and in so doing to stimulate our faith, confidence, and maturity in Christ.",098173216X,9780981732169,188,Daniel Smith, , ,4.00,5,1,Granted Ministries Press,August 2010,Paperback, ,3559-9305436-pilgrim-of-the-heavenly-way.html

In fact, the controversial author continues, the so-called history we learn in school is no more than a brand, developed by white men who, often unjustly, won the right to spin their stories as hard facts. With Autobiography of a Blue-Eyed Devil, it's Muscio's turn and she's taking it in order to hip the masses to the truth about the American history they think they know. Whose country is it? Has democracy ever really existed? Why does our culture celebrate certain figures and ignore others? Do schools teach kids to perpetuate white supremacist ideologies? Muscio delves deep to answer these questions, marveling at how personal history is to everyone, while challenging people to expand their thinking on America's past and encouraging them to consider how their own histories might read.",1580051197,9781580051194,256,Inga Muscio, , ,3.92,427,55,Seal Press,June 30th 2005,Paperback,English,357-232927.Autobiography_of_a_Blue_Eyed_Devil.html
2849,"The Conversion of Herman the Jew: Autobiography, History, and Fiction in the Twelfth Century","Sometime toward the middle of the twelfth century, it is supposed, an otherwise obscure figure, born a Jew in Cologne and later ordained as a priest in Cappenberg in Westphalia, wrote a Latin account of his conversion to Christianity. Known as the ""Opusculum,"" this book purportedly by ""Herman, the former Jew"" may well be the first autobiography to be written in the West after the ""Confessions"" of Saint Augustine. It may also be something else entirely. In ""The Conversion of Herman the Jew"" the eminent French historian Jean-Claude Schmitt examines this singular text and the ways in which it has divided its readers. Where some have seen it as an authentic conversion narrative, others have asked whether it is not a complete fabrication forged by Christian clerics. For Schmitt the question is poorly posed. The work is at once true and fictional, and the search for its lone author--whether converted Jew or not--fruitless. Herman may well have existed and contributed to the writing of his life, but the ""Opusculum"" is a collective work, perhaps framed to meet a specific institutional agenda. With agility and erudition, Schmitt examines the text to explore its meaning within the society and culture of its period and its participation in both a Christian and Jewish imaginary. What can it tell us about autobiography and subjectivity, about the function of dreams and the legitimacy of religious images, about individual and collective conversion, and about names and identities? In ""The Conversion of Herman the Jew"" Schmitt masterfully seizes upon the debates surrounding the ""Opusculum"" (the text of which is newly translated for this volume) to ponder more fundamentally the ways in which historians think and write.",0812222199,9780812222197,320,Jean-Claude Schmitt,Alex J.

L'auteure de Bonheur d'occasion y retrace ce qu'on pourrait appeler ses années de formation : sa jeunesse dans la petite communauté francophone de Saint-Boniface au Manitoba, son métier d'institutrice, ses longs séjours en Europe, puis son établissement à Montréal. On tombe sous le charme de ces scènes que l'on croirait arrachées à la vie, tellement Gabrielle Roy excelle à faire revivre le passé comme si elle y était encore, à extraire de chaque instant ce qui le rend unique. Sous sa plume, qui épouse de si près ses émotions, brille son don du regard, cette faculté aiguë de discerner les merveilles et les blessures du monde, son amour des gens simples et de la vie. Composée des deux premiers chapitres d'une œuvre qui en aurait compté quatre si son auteure n'avait été arrêtée par la maladie, l'autobiographie se termine en 1939, au moment où Gabrielle Roy s'apprête à se lancer dans l'écriture. Un peu augmentée depuis par la publication posthume du Temps qui m'a manqué , La Détresse et l'Enchantement est ce genre de livre que l'on quitte à regret, en ayant l'impression de dire au revoir à une amie très chère.

2855,"The Two Autobiographies: ""The Story of My Life"" by Helen Keller the Adult/""My Story"" by Helen Keller the Child (Age 12)","Helen Keller’s well-known autobiography, the story of her life up to age 21, portions of which were adapted for the play and movie “The Miracle Worker,” was written while she was in college and published in 1903. It is Part I of a three-part publication, with Part II containing letters written by Helen Keller and Part III containing a supplementary account of her education (from reports of her teacher, Anne Sullivan). Both the book itself and the first portion of the book were entitled “The Story of My Life.” Much less known is the shorter autobiography, “My Story,” Helen Keller wrote at age 12 especially for a magazine called “Youth’s Companion.” As Helen Keller explained in her adult autobiography: “[Miss Sullivan] persuaded me to write for the ‘Youth’s Companion’ a brief account of my life. I was then twelve years old. As I look back on my struggle to write that little story, it seems to me that I must have had a prophetic vision of the good that would come of the undertaking, or I should surely have failed. I wrote timidly, fearfully, but resolutely, urged on by my teacher.” When “Youth’s Companion” published the four-part account, Helen Keller was not yet well known, and her story was prefaced by the explanatory remark: “Written wholly without help of any sort by Helen Keller, a deaf and blind girl, twelve years old, and printed without change.” This Nook edition includes the complete text of both autobiographies of Helen Keller: Part I of “The Story of My Life” (Parts II and III, containing her letters and the supplemental account of her education, are not included), and the very rare autobiography of 12-year-old Helen Keller, “My Story.”",, ,0,Helen Keller, , ,3.89,9,2, , ,Kindle Edition,English,3576-11614360-the-two-autobiographies.html
2856,The Good Life: The Autobiography Of Tony Bennett,"He's that regular guy from Astoria, Queens, who left his heart in San Francisco. He's the postwar heartthrob who inspired hundreds of young girls to wear black outside St. Patrick's Cathedral on his wedding day. He's the darling of the MTV generation who made music history when, at the age of 68, he won the coveted Grammy Award&#174; for Album of the Year. He's the consummate artist known worldwide for his paintings. He's Tony Bennett, whose star shines brighter than ever as he enters his fifth decade of performing. Now, for the first time, this legend shares his amazing life story -- in a voice that's pure Tony Bennett: warm, resonant, and unforgettable. ""Tony Bennett has not just bridged the generation gap, he has demolished it,"" praised The New York Times. Since his appearance with the Red Hot Chili Peppers of the 1993 MTV Video Awards, and the addition of his seminal video, ""Steppin' Out,"" to the MTV playlist, Bennett has become the hottest -- and coolest -- pop-culture icon for today's younger listeners, while remaining beloved by their parents and grandparents. An astonishing four generations have experienced the Tony Bennett magic -- the mesmerizing spell of a singer in love with singing, who embraces his audience with a soulful serenity communicated by both the man and his music. Honored with countless awards, including eight Grammys, and with more than ninety albums to his credit (more than thirty million sold for the Columbia label alone), no other recording artist has attained Bennett's stature -- or garnered the half-century of memories shared in The Good Life. From Sinatra, Judy Garland and Ella Fitzgerald, to k.d. lang and Elvis Costello, Bennett shares his unique takes on the most fascinating talents of our time. Here is the story of his lifelong love affair with art, music, and performing -- from his childhood in Depression-era Queens, where opera and Billie Holiday flowed freely; to his stint as a singing waiter; to soaking up the New York jazz scene in the 1940s. With crisp wit and firmly grounded emotion, Bennett captures the people and places that shaped his sublime performances. The dozens of hits he introduced to the great American songbook, including ""Because of You,"" ""Rags to Riches,"" ""Cold, Cold Heart,"" and his signature song, ""I Left My Heart in Son Francisco,"" remain a legacy of truth and beauty for the classic art of intimate singing. In this wonderfully revealing self-portrait, we get to know Tony Bennett as he really is: an unpretentious and thoughtful human being. His key to success is consistency: His constant dedication in his pursuit of excellence has never wavered, despite the trials and tribulations one can encounter when placing integrity above all else. Through all of his personal and artistic challenges, he has remained, in his own words, ""a humanist"" whose Zen-like philosophy of life is an inspiration for all ages. Like the fascinating story he shares in The Good Life, Tony Bennett is one of a kind, an American treasure, an enduring artist seasoned with experience and self-knowledge, and a true class act.",1451634994,9781451634990,304,Tony Bennett, , ,3.56,64,7,Atria Books,December 7th 2010,ebook,English,3577-10529893-the-good-life.html

2859,Cheech & Chong: The Unauthorized Autobiography,"Dave's Not Here, ManBut America's favorite stoner comedian, Tommy Chong, is back and funnier than ever as he takes us on a nostalgic trip through his career with partner Richard ""Cheech"" Marin. Over the course of their decades-long partnership, Cheech and Chong performed to sold-out crowds across the country, made nine hit albums, starred in eight blockbuster movies, and created memorable and iconic characters that still resonate with fans today. But the good life didn't just appear in a haze of smoke. It all started during the late 1960s in a strip club in the fragile heart of Vancouver's Chinatown, where Tommy was winding down his career as a Motown recording artist and starting an improv comedy troupe, and Cheech was a draft-dodging, pottery-throwing, underground music reviewer. Together they came to define the hippie-era counterculture, and theircelebrated movie debut, ""Up in Smoke,"" remains one of the highest-grossing Warner Bros. films ever. In his very own unauthorized autobiography, ""New York Times"" bestselling author and pop culture hero Chong reveals his unique relationship with Cheech and recalls the inspiration for their most beloved bits. He introduces famous guest stars like Peter Sellers, John Belushi, Jimi Hendrix, Dan Aykroyd, John Lennon, Diana Ross, and Jack Nicholson, and examines the influences that had the greatest impact on his comedy -- from R&B musicians and Redd Foxx to Lenny Bruce and (of course) marijuana. Finally, with keen insight and utter candor, he explores the rift that has separated the legendary comedy team for more than twenty years.

""Robert Cracknell must be the least typical psychic in the world,"" writes author COLIN WILSON in his foreword to this electrifying autobiography. ""To encounter Cracknell is a refreshing, or possibly a traumatic, experience...He is totally down-to-earth, blunt, aggressive and impatient; he is also intelligent, honest, and obsessively, almost self-destructively, devoted to his own vision of the truth. The fact is that, as a psychic, Cracknell is a total Outsider... the alienated man who has to learn to turn his powers of development inward... Cracknell represents something completely new in this strange field of the paranormal... He has a natural vitality and frankness that makes his book absorbing reading. His is a voice that needs and deserves to be heard.""",1933665513,9781933665511,330,Robert Cracknell,Colin Wilson, ,5.00,1,0,Anomalist Books,March 31st 2011,Paperback,English,3582-11570192-the-lonely-sense.html
2863,Triggs: The Autobiography of Roy Keane's dog,"A loyal dog. Her infamous master. And the shocking truth about who was really walking whom. In a decade when Roy Keane was seldom out of the news - whether leading Manchester United to the Treble or telling Mick McCarthy to shove the World Cup up his bollocks on the Pacific island of Saipan - his adored Labrador Retriever Triggs was never far from his side. In this sensational account, the brilliant but illness-obsessed dog finally speaks out about what it was like to be a central player in the extraordinary drama of her master's life. Eight major trophies. A missed Champions League final. Player of the Year awards. Alfe-Inge Haaland. Drunken nights. Contract negotiations. Patrick Vieira. Prawn sandwiches. The explosive end to his relationships with Ireland and Manchester United. And Bob Dylan. Triggs was a witness to it all - and a far from silent one. Her remarkable account is funny, frank and never less than one hundred and ten per cent faithful. 'This is no ordinary football autobiography. And it's not some saccharine-sweet love story about a man and his beloved pooch. I was no Marley. And, God knows, Roy was no John Grogan.' Triggs 'Dogs don't talk s**t.'

2865,The Fiction of Autobiography: Reading and Writing Identity,"Writing autobiography is a complicated, often fraught activity for both writer and reader. We can find many recent examples of the way such writing calls into question the author's truthfulness or their authority to present as definitive their ‘version' of a particular event or portion of their lives. Drawing upon a wide range of late twentieth and early twenty-first-century autobiographical writing, The Fiction of Autobiography examines key aspects of autobiography from the interrelated perspectives of author, reader, critic and scholar, to reconsider how we view this form of writing, and its relationship to the way we understand and construct identity. Maftei considers recent cases and texts such as Didion's The Year of Magical Thinking and Frey's A Million Little Pieces alongside older texts such as Proust's In Search of Lost Time ¸ Nabokov's Speak, Memory and Stein's The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas . In part, this is to emphasise that key issues reappear and arise over decades and centuries, and that texts distanced by time can speak to each other thoughtfully and poignantly.",, ,208,Micaela Maftei, , ,3.33,3,0,Bloomsbury Academic,July 4th 2013,Kindle Edition,English,3585-19781046-the-fiction-of-autobiography.html

But the truth is far more interesting—and surprising. Son of film stars Fernando Lamas and Arlene Dahl, and stepson of swimmer and actress Esther Williams, Lorenzo was born into Hollywood royalty.

He delves deep into his relationships with his six children and with his famous father, whose penetrating words of wisdom have guided him through turbulent times and to a sense of renewal and new beginnings. Featuring 50 rare, never-before-shared family and personal photographs from his private collection, Renegade at Heart is everything Lamas's millions of fans have been waiting for—the unvarnished truth and his side of his remarkable journey and fully fleshed rumination of the highs and lows of an extraordinary life and survival of an extraordinary man and actor.",1941631258,9781941631256,272,Lorenzo Lamas,Jeff Lenburg, ,3.00,3,1,BenBella Books,December 9th 2014,Hardcover, ,361-22891950-renegade-at-heart.html

Following his family tradition (The Education of Henry Adams was written by his great-uncle), George Caspar Homans describes how his ideas about the proper nature of theory in social science, both in form and content, have developed over time. The chief interest of the book lies in the description of this process. Homans' career has spanned many of the key periods of development in social research, and his own work has been central to the process. He was the first major sociologist to outline the sociological implications of psychologists' work on learning or behavior theory. His contributions to modern sociology have had a major impact on the study of small groups, the problem of theory and methods of theory construction, and the study of basic characteristics of social behavior. He is regarded as the father of social exchange theory. Homans considers academic and intellectual as well as nonacademic influences on his development: personalities of highly idiosyncratic individuals against whose views of culturalism, functionalism, and structuralism he reacted, discussions with colleagues, reading, as well as his ancestry, his childhood in Boston, his literary education and later social-life in Boston, and his experiences as a sea captain in the Navy in World War II. This is an absorbing book, both an autobiography and a history of the development of the social sciences in the post World War II era.",0887380018,9780887380013,370,George Caspar Homans, , ,3.00,2,0,Transaction Publishers,January 1st 1984,Hardcover,English,3615-1211850.Coming_To_My_Senses.html
2899,The Autobiography of an ExtraTerrestrial Saga: Waking Thyron,"""In 1959, an ExtraTerrestrial incarnated on Earth. He doesn’t remember who he is; but his cells hold his past-life memories. After twenty-six years of spiritual education as a human, Cosmic Thought Adjusters determine that he is ready to know the truth, so they awaken him to his heritage. He was an instructor at the University of Melchizedek, where he trained Mighty Messengers to incarnate on Earth for secret “consciousness raising” programs, and in this incarnation, he has traveled with them. This is the autobiography of Solar Commander Thyron—whose mission it is to unite Earth with Universal Society. Now that this Earthman’s heart rules his mind, communications with enlightened extraterrestrials are permitted, and a trip to his home and awaiting family in the Pleiades Star System is facilitated.Ultimately, Thyron’s Earth body is put into a slumber, and he is returned to his former Titan self. His family reunion is short-lived in the face of a galactic crisis. The evil forces—knowing of his brief homecoming—steal what is most precious to him, luring him into direct combat. His only armor is courage and a powerful Crystal Light Sword of Truth, given to him by Archangel Michael, his sovereign, just before he is thrust into the most barbaric cosmic war ever recorded. His enemy, the Dark Sa’ Tan, commands the Brubarian armies—terrifying beasts, who wield impressive black-art technologies. Now a leader amongst extraterrestrials in the Star Seed Alignment of Space Peoples and Planets, the fate of the universe hangs in the balance, and not even Thyron can imagine what awaits him. http://www.AutobiographyOfAnET.com """,, ,487,Craig Campobasso, , ,4.33,3,0,AuthorHouse,December 16th 2014,Kindle Edition,English,3616-24115322-the-autobiography-of-an-extraterrestrial-saga.html

2917,Composing Selves: Southern Women and Autobiography,"In Composing Selves, award-winning author Peggy Whitman Prenshaw provides the most comprehensive treatment of autobiographies by women in the American South. This long-anticipated addition to Prenshaw's study of southern literature spans the twentieth century as she provides an in-depth look at the life-writing of eighteen women authors. Composing Selves travels the wide terrain of female life in the South, analyzing various issues that range from racial consciousness to the deflection of personal achievement. All of the authors presented came of age during the era Prenshaw refers to as the ""late southern Victorian period,"" which began in 1861 and ended in the 1930s. Belle Kearney's A Slaveholder's Daughter (1900) with Elizabeth Spencer's Landscapes of the Heart and Ellen Douglas's Truth: Four Stories I Am Finally Old Enough to Tell (both published in 1998) chronologically bookend Prenshaw's survey.

The book also examines Katharine DuPre Lumpkin's The Making of a Southerner and Lillian Smith's Killers of the Dream. In addition to exploring multiple themes, Prenshaw considers a number of types of autobiographies, such as Helen Keller's classic The Story of My Life and Anne Walter Fearn's My Days of Strength. She treats narratives of marital identity, as in Mary Hamilton's Trials of the Earth, and calls attention to works by women who devoted their lives to social and political movements, like Virginia Durr's Outside the Magic Circle.

2933,A Bazaar Life: The Autobiography of David Alliance,"At the age of thirteen, David Alliance was taken out of school by his father and apprenticed into the Grand Bazaar in Tehran, where he learned the business skills that were to prove invaluable in one of the most successful business careers of modern times. In 1950, with just £14 in his pocket, he arrived in Manchester in search of textile bargains, going hungry and sometimes forced to sleep on the street. Six years later, however, when he was still only twenty-four, he bought a loss-making textile mill, turned it around in six months and went on to build the biggest textile company in the Western world. At one stage his businesses, including his mail-order company, N Brown Group, employed more than 80,000 people. He did it through a mixture of incredibly hard work, creativity and nerve, and some of his takeovers, often of companies many times larger than his own, were breathtaking in their ingenuity. No obstacle was unscalable – his guiding principle all his life was that everything is achievable ‘if you put your heart and soul into it’. Humble, charming and delightfully honest, Alliance’s extraordinary rags-to-riches tale is not only that of a remarkable journey, but goes far beyond the world of business. Among many stories which have until now remained secret, Alliance tells of how he used the skills he learned in the bazaar to negotiate with the dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam to allow the Ethiopian Jews to be airlifted to Israel, his friendship with the Shah of Iran and the first-hand insight into the infamous Guinness affair. In A Bazaar Life, written with Ivan Fallon, he sets out the lessons he has learned in a long career, and the principles that have guided him. Young – and older – entrepreneurs can learn a lot from his story.",, ,448,David Alliance,Ivan Fallon,Peter Mandelson,4.00,2,1,Robson Pres,February 5th 2015,Kindle Edition,English,3647-24859537-a-bazaar-life.html
2934,"Sex, Lies, and Autobiography: The Ethics of Confession","In ""Sex, Lies, and Autobiography"" James O'Rourke explores the relationships between literary form and ethics, revealing how autobiographical texts are able to confront readers with the moral complexities of everyday life. Tracing the ethical legacy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ""Confessions"" in a series of English-language texts, the author shows how Rousseau's doubts about the possibility of ethical behavior in everyday life shadows the first-person narratives of five canonic works: William Wordsworth's ""Prelude, ""Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre"" and ""Villette, ""Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein, ""and Vladimir Nabokov's ""Lolita."" Offering a fascinating new way of thinking about ethics through literature, Sex, Lies, and Autobiography challenges the most fundamental principles of the philosophical study of ethics, revealing the innate difference between morality in life and morality in literature. O'Rourke begins with Rousseau's inability to reconcile his intuitive belief that he is a good person with the effects that his actions have on others, and he goes on to show how this same ethical impasse recurs in the five aforementioned texts. The ethical crises these texts describe, such as when Jane Eyre's happiness can be purchased only at the cost of Bertha Mason's suicide, or when Humbert Humbert's artistry demands the sacrifice of Dolores Haze, are not instances of authorial ethical blindness, O'Rourke says, but rather are ethical challenges that force us as readers to consider our own lives. In each of these works, a narrator attempts to justify his or her behavior and fails; in each case, the rigorous narrative of self-examination demands a similar effort from the reader, whose own sense of moral rectitude is put into question. Confronting the long-held philosophical construction that links ethical principles and life choices, thereby reassuring us of the ethical coherence of everyday life, the narrators of these literary autobiographies come to a very different conclusion; by looking back on their lives, they cannot understand how their most benevolent desires led to such damaging life stories. By leaving meaning inexplicit, O'Rourke argues, these texts are able to recover traumatic material that is ordinarily repressed and then bring that repressed knowledge to bear on self-justifying narratives. For readers interested in autobiographical studies, ethical criticism, and trauma and literary studies, ""Sex, Lies, and Autobiography"" provides a groundbreaking analysis of the role of ethics in literature.",0813925126,9780813925127,215,James O'Rourke, , ,0.00,0,0,University of Virginia Press,February 16th 2006,Hardcover,English,3648-1927506.Sex_Lies_and_Autobiography.html

Ma whipped me with a strap until I bled. She lifted the prongs on the strap to create greater punishment. She’d beat me within an inch of my life. This occurred time after time from when I was four years old until I was sixteen and mature enough to stop her. She didn’t care how much blood was on my face or head or arms and legs. Most of the time, I didn’t know why I was getting whipped. She loved to whip me. She didn’t want sex with my Dad, so she got her rocks off whipping me. She had an orgasm whenever she whipped me. When Ma was having her orgasms, she’d start signing praises to Jesus and would get high from inflicting pain on me. But I never flinched. I took it and never cried or yelled out. I steeled myself each time to the abuse and pain being inflicted on me. I never surrendered.

But upheaval in Europe during and after World War II led him to the United States where he immersed himself in science and soon began building a research group at one of the powerhouses of scientific discovery. The Sputnik wake-up call that triggered the huge influx of government support for scientific research in the second half of the twentieth century bolstered fundamental research programs like the one Somorjai established at the University of California, Berkeley, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Key discoveries in his field, surface science, led the way to advances in catalysis know-how that underpin today’s energy storage and transformation technology and safeguard the environment. By revealing the unique ways microscopically thin layers of atoms and molecules control the chemistry and physics of surfaces, modern surface science also spawned rapid development in microelectronics, high-power computing, and communication and information technology.",148080147X,9781480801479,268,Gabor A.

2942,"Forever Flying an Autobiography of R. A. ""Bob"" Hoover","Barnstormer, World War II fighter, test pilot, aerobatic genius -- Bob Hoover is a living aviation legend, the man General James ""Jimmy"" Doolittle called ""the greatest stick and rudder pilot who ever lived."" Hoover's career spans the history of American aviation, and now he tells his amazing story with all the flat-out honesty and gusto that have made his life an extraordinary adventure. At twenty-two, Hoover was a decorated World War II fighter pilot, already famous both for his aerobatic abilities -- including looping under a bridge in Tunisia -- and for surviving seventeen equipment-failure crash landings as a test pilot. Then the Germans knocked his Mark V Spitfire out of the sky. He made three attempts to escape en route to the infamous Stalag I prison camp, and after sixteen brutal months, finally escaped by stealing a German plane and flying it to Holland. After the war, Hoover tested the first jets at Wright Field, dogfighting Chuck Yeager, the man who'd come to call him ""Pard."" In the quest to break the sound barrier in the Bell X-1, Hoover endured every step of the grueling G-force training along with Yeager. But soon after Yeager's historic flight, Hoover broke both his legs in a desperate bailout from a blazing F-84 Thunderjet -- dashing his dreams of flying the X-1 himself. In Forever Flying, we relive the thrills and danger Hoover continued to face as a civilian test pilot: testing the first jets to take off and land aboard aircraft carriers; flying bombing runs over North Korea; and demonstrating new planes for fighter pilots, who had to be warned not to attempt to duplicate Hoover's spectacular spins, stalls, and rolls. He became an adviser to engineering on the X-15 rocket, and rose through the corporate ranks, famed for flying his daring aerobatics routines in a business suit and straw hat instead of a pilot's ""G suit."" Bob Hoover has flown more than 300 types of aircraft, dazzled crowds at more than 2,000 air shows all over the world, and is still flying today. He's set both transcontinental and ""time to climb"" speed records, and known such great aviators as Orville Wright, Eddie Rickenbacker, Charles Lindbergh, Jacqueline Cochran, Neil Armstrong, and Yuri Gagarin, who saved Hoover from the KGB at an international aerobatics competition in Moscow during the height of the Cold War. Spiced by reminiscences from fellow fliers, friends, and his wife, all of whom recount Hoover's devilish practical jokes as well as his death-defying flights, Forever Flying reveals the magnificent true story of a great American hero.",0743270509,9780743270502,0,R.A.

2947,The Autobiography of the Queen,"Queen Elizabeth has gone AWOL from Balmoral and no one can find her. Where has she gone and why? This winsome, if unlikely, account of the Queen's disappearance, recounts the monarch's solo journey to the Caribbean island of St. Lucia, to take possession of her recently purchased home in the idyllic-sounding Joli Estate. Here, after more than half a century on the throne, she will recall the years of her reign in peace and tranquility in the guise of her new identity as Gloria Smith. But the house is no more than a muddy hole in the ground, and the Queen must punt. She is not used to asking for anything, carrying cash, fending for herself, introducing herself, or being ignored. The story of the sovereign's sojourn in her former colony is a funny and touching account of the sometimes contentious and occasionally baffling friendship between Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and a scruffy young St. Lucian, Austin Ford. How this radical change of life and circumstance affects the Queen and how she changes as a result make for a hilarious and moving tale in which her need for her subjects is as marked as their dependence on her staying on the throne.",1905147880,9781905147885,218,Emma Tennant, , ,2.73,67,15,Bliss Books,April 1st 2008,Hardcover,English,366-2093178.The_Autobiography_of_the_Queen.html

2952,Act Like You Know: African-American Autobiography and White Identity,"Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, W.E.B. DuBois, Zora Neale Hurston, Malcolm X—their words speak firmly, eloquently, personally of the impact of white America on the lives of African-Americans. Black autobiographical discourses, from the earliest slave narratives to the most contemporary urban raps, have each in their own way gauged and confronted the character of white society. For Crispin Sartwell, as philosopher, cultural critic, and white male, these texts, through their exacting insights and external perspective, provide a rare opportunity, a means of glimpsing and gaining access to contents and core of white identity. There is, Sartwell contends, a fundamental elusiveness to that identity. Whiteness defines itself as normative, as a neutral form of the human condition, marking all other forms of identity as ""racial"" or ""ethnic"" deviations. Invisible to itself, white identity seeks to define its essence over and against those other identities, in effect defining itself through opposition and oppression. By maintaining fictions of black licentiousness, violence, and corruption, white identity is able to cast itself as humane, benevolent, and pure; the stereotype fabricates not only the oppressed but the oppressor as well. Sartwell argues that African-American autobiography perceives white identity from a particular and unique vantage point; one that is knowledgeable and intimate, yet fundamentally removed from the white world and thus unencumbered by its obfuscating claims to normativity. Throughout this provocative work, Sartwell steadfastly recognizes the many ways in which he too is implicated in the formulation and perpetuation of racial attitudes and discourse. In Act Like You Know , he challenges both himself and others to take a long, hard look in the mirror of African-American autobiography, and to find there, in the light of those narratives, the visible features of white identity.",0226735273,9780226735276,222,Crispin Sartwell, , ,3.60,5,2,University Of Chicago Press,July 20th 1998,Paperback,English,3664-855042.Act_Like_You_Know.html

His gripping and characteristically humorous autobiography journeys from Jimmy's childhood in the East End, via his early career at Chelsea and his short and troubled stay at A.C. Milan, to his emergence as one of the great stars of sixties football while at Spurs and an outstanding England forward. Jimmy's record as a striker is extraordinary - he was the leading goalscorer in the First Division - now Premiership - for six seasons and during his playing career was never out of the top five. There are darker aspects too: the bitter disappointment of failing to make the World Cup-winning team of 1966, and the battle against the alcoholism that followed his retirement from the game. This book is both Jimmy's story and the story of football in the golden era of the fifties and sixties before money changed the game. It is populated by the great players whom Jimmy played with and against and animated by wonderful anecdotes about the game.

And when the problems that Roland's disability presented began to overwhelm them, they had no choice but to resign themselves to that original advice. Roland Johnson spent half his childhood at Pennhurst State School outside Philadelphia, where he saw fellow residents abused and where he himself was abused. But somehow he was able to keep his spirit alive. When he won his freedom as a young adult, he spent several years putting his life together. Then, as president of Speaking For Ourselves, he became an internationally known speaker and leader in the self-advocacy movement. Roland Johnson was a man of great courage and vision and determination. He had what can be called an alternate kind of intelligence - one not based on the ability to manipulate data. In Roland Johnson's world understanding - one person for another - is the way of the future, the only route to true freedom. Though virtually unknown in his lifetime outside the self-advocacy movement, he was a pioneer: his life traced a path no one had trod before - he escaped the hell his disability had consigned him to and went on to speak out and organize on behalf of his brothers and sisters.",0967225604,9780967225609,121,Roland Johnson, , ,2.00,1,0,Speaking for Ourselves,June 25th 1999,Paperback,English,3676-3489255-lost-in-a-desert-world.html

2968,One Man’s Everest: The Autobiography of Kenton Cool,"Kenton Cool is the finest alpine climber of this generation. His accomplishments are staggering. He has summited Everest eleven times. He is the first person in history to climb the three Everest peaks, the so-called Triple Crown, in one climb, a feat previously thought impossible. He was nominated for the prestigious piolet d'Or in 2004 for climbing a previously unclimbed route on Annapurna III. In 2012 he fulfilled the Olympic Games pledge of placing a 1924 gold medal on the Everest summit. He is the only Briton to have skied down two 8000-metre mountains, and in 2009 he guided Sir Ranulph Fiennes to the summit of Everest, helping to raise over £3 million for Marie Curie Cancer Care. His accomplishments are all the more extraordinary considering an incident in the summer of 1996 which tore Kenton's world apart. Whilst climbing in Wales, he broke a handhold on a route aptly called 'Major Headstress' and fell to the ground with such force that he shattered both his heel bones. Initially told he would never walk unaided again, Kenton spent four weeks in hospital, had three operations, three and a half months in a wheelchair and months of rehab. Today he is still in pain and after a long day in the mountains it's not uncommon to see him struggling to walk or moving around on his hands and knees. Yet he still climbs. 'Why do you do it?' people ask him. This book tells why.",1409052397,9781409052395,0,Kenton Cool, , ,5.00,1,0,Preface Digital,August 27th 2015,ebook, ,3679-25488765-one-man-s-everest.html

2973,Bobby Robson: Farewell but not Goodbye - My Autobiography,"Sir Bobby Robson died on the morning of 31 July 2009. Revered in Newcastle and the North East, he was a man who enjoyed phenomenal popularity, and touched so many people with his sincerity and passion for the game of football. From his playing days with Fulham and West Brom in the 1950s and 60s, to his twenty England caps and his brilliant management career, Bobby Robson inspired generations of fans. However, Bobby's story is not just about these great achievements. In this book he provided a fascinating insight into his childhood and early adult years growing up in the North East, and his working life before football in the mines of Langley Park, where he went underground for a year and a half at the age of fifteen. One of English football's most successful managers, Bobby witnessed some of the most historic sporting moments during his incredible career, including such epic incidents as the 'Hand of God' and Gazza's tears. He wrote of leading England through two World Cups and the agony of coming within a penalty kick of the 1990 World Cup final. Bobby's story takes in many countries, many clubs and many of the world's most illustrious players. He inspired deep affection for the qualities that he always embodied: passion, humour, hard work and fair play.

2978,A Life Re-Invented: The Secret Autobiography of Thomas Edison,"A Life Re-Invented tells the story of a failed inventor named Thomas Edison, who accidentally invents a device that allows him the unique opportunity to change his past and re-live his life. As he recklessly embarks on his journey through time he leaves a wake of death and destruction that only worsens as he attempts to atone for his mistakes. Here is the entire introduction: ""Stop reading this immediately. This volume was not intended for your eyes, nor anybody else's. I have made the conscious decision to not publish my own autobiography, although many publishers and acquaintances have implored me to do so. Several biographies have already been written about me even before my death, and there are sure to be many more after my death, and I encourage you to explore one of those. They contain the story of my rich, full life, the story of how I became wealthier than I ever could have imagined, and how I became one of the most famous people on the planet, my name and accomplishments known to presidents and kings. I will certainly go down in history as one of the most important men who has ever walked the Earth. These published accounts are those that I wish to be made known to the world, and though they seem to cover my life from cradle to grave, or nearly so, they cover only half of the story, and even that half is enough to make me nearly legendary. The other half of my life's story is known to nobody but me, but as hard as it may be to believe, it is even more incredible than my well-known side. I have never even hinted about it to my wives, my children, nor my closest friends, and they wouldn't believe me if I told them. I have become incredibly rich and famous by inventing many wonderful things that have changed the world, but my most important discovery, my most important invention, is completely unknown to the world, despite being the greatest accomplishment in the history of humankind. I only wrote this volume for my own use, to document an incredible period of my life that I wish to remain private. I intend to destroy this volume before my death, but if you are reading it then my plans were obviously thwarted for some reason. Whatever those reasons might be, the fact remains that I do not wish, under any circumstances, to share this portion of my life's story with you or any other person. So please respect my wishes and my privacy, and put this volume back where you found it and forget you ever saw it. Thank you."" I hope you enjoy it, and if you do, please consider leaving a review.

2979,Angels Along My Path of Thorns: An Autobiography,"This story is about a girl growing up in Guatemala, a girl who had to endure many horrifying experiences within her family and from without. The book is an action-adventure story written in novel style. It encompasses her fight against the sexist dominant culture; a kidnapping; sexual, physical and mental abuse at the hands of a psychopathic criminal; an attempted murder; a daring escape; eventual rescue by caring friends and strangers; and victory through a determination to never be defeated. The town of San Pedro Pinula was a town without electricity and the common mode of transportation to and from the surrounding farm and ranch land was and still is by foot or on horseback. In this setting the dramatic events that enveloped Gabriela give the story an atmosphere of a wild-west adventure. In addition to the telling of the horrific events, there are poignant, loving, critical, and at times amusing portraits of Gabriela's mother, father, cousins, boarding school experiences, school mates, her first love and the angels who appeared to save her from certain ruin and near death. Interwoven in the story is a portrait of small town and rural life in one region of Guatemala; with descriptions of local customs, religion, housing, schooling, and transportation. There are more than thirty photographs of people and places that figure in the story. Detailed maps are also included to assist the reader. Gabriela's story is one of victory over adversity through tenacity, bravery, and hope. Her fondest wish is that her story will be not just an exciting and excellent read, which it is; but will also be an inspiration to others who have suffered extreme adversity through no fault of their own.",1412096561,9781412096560,328,Gabriela A.

2980,"Tales of Wonder: Adventures Chasing the Divine, an Autobiography","Huston Smith, the man who brought the world's religions to the West, was born almost a century ago to missionary parents in China during the perilous rise of the Communist Party. Smith's lifelong spiritual journey brought him face-to-face with many of the people who shaped the twentieth century. His extraordinary travels around the globe have taken him to the world's holiest places, where he has practiced religion with many of the great spiritual leaders of our time. Smith's life is a story of uncanny synchronicity. He was there for pivotal moments in human history such as the founding of the United Nations and the student uprising at Tiananmen Square. As he traveled the world he encountered thinkers who shaped the twentieth century. He interviewed Eleanor Roosevelt on the radio; invited Martin Luther King Jr. to speak at an all-white university before the March on Washington; shared ideas with Thomas Merton on his last plane ride before Merton's death in Bangkok; and was rescued while lost in the Serengeti by Masai warriors who took him to the compound of world-renowned anthropologists Louis and Mary Leaky. In search of intellectual and spiritual treasures, Smith traveled to India to meet with Mother Teresa and befriended the Dalai Lama; he studied Zen at the most challenging monastery in Japan; and he hitchhiked through the desert to meet Aldous Huxley, dropped acid with Timothy Leary, and took peyote with a Native American shaman. He climbed Mount Athos, traipsed through the Holy Land, and was the first to study multiphonic chanting by monks in Tibet, which he recorded with Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead. Most important, he shared the world's religions with the West—writing two bestselling books and serving as the focus of a five-part PBS television series by Bill Moyers. Huston Smith is a national treasure. His life is an extraordinary adventure, and in his amazing Tales of Wonder , he invites you to come along to explore your own vistas of heart, mind, and soul.",0061154261,9780061154263,188,Huston Smith, , ,3.89,239,46,HarperOne,May 12th 2009,Hardcover,English,369-4222760-tales-of-wonder.html

2987,Uwe Rosler - My Autobiography: Knocking Down Walls,"Uwe Rosler's passion and determination is never far from the surface, and it's that drive that changed the path he seemed set to follow. Destined for an unremarkable career in East Germany, where the Berlin Wall presented a greater mental boundary than the bricks and mortar that formed the physical division between two different worlds, Uwe was 25 and heading nowhere. Then, a chance for the raw talent that had been contained in his repressive surrounds was to be set loose, as he was offered the chance of a loan at struggling English Premier League club, Manchester City. The contrast between 'Madchester' and his homeland could not have been more marked. The mullet-haired striker was an instant hit, his goals helping City survive relegation and winning him a permanent deal. Voted Player of the Year in his first full season in England, over the next four years Rosler wrote his name into City folklore and became a terrace idol. The fans loved his raw passion, commitment and the fact he wore his heart on his sleeve - that, plus his goals. However, once he fell out with boss Alan Ball, there was only going to be one winner. For three successive years he finished top scorer, and stayed with City when they were relegated. Unfortunately another relegation resulted in severe cut-backs and he had to move on, initially returning to Germany and a first stint in the Bundesliga with Kaiserslautern. He soon returned to England with Southampton before a spell with West Bromwich Albion brought an end to his playing days in a country he called his second home. He finished his playing career with Norwegian side Lillestrom, where he soon faced a bigger battle than anything he'd faced in football. Diagnosed with chest cancer, Uwe was forced to reassess his life and ambitions as he began receiving treatment. Was it time to leave the game if the chemotherapy was successful? Lifted by an incredible show of affection from the City fans, who he listened to on a mobile phone singing his name during a home game while stricken in hospital, Rosler made a remarkable recovery. After being given a clean bill of health, he moved into management with Lillestrom. He remained there for two years, then enhanced his reputation further with Viking, where he remained for four years. He then had a short spell with Molde, saving the club from relegation before being replaced by returning superstar Ole Gunnar Solkjaer. Undeterred, Uwe decided to try his hand in England, where he had recently been voted into the Manchester City Hall of Fame. Brentford offered him that chance - and he immediately made an impact. He guided the Bees to their highest finish in six years in his first season, then came within a coat of paint of guiding his side to promotion a year later - only to see his dream turn to dust in a matter of 30 crazy seconds on the final day of the 2012/13 campaign. No matter. His dream is to manage in the Premier League, and Uwe will keep going until he succeeds. There's not been a wall built yet he hasn't scaled and almost 15 years since he left City, the fans still regularly sing his name. Now read his fascinating life story -",1908695226,9781908695222,288,Uwe Rosler, , ,3.00,2,1,Trinity Mirror Sport Media,October 31st 2013,Hardcover,English,3696-18817108-uwe-rosler---my-autobiography.html

3000,All Things Being Equal: The Autobiography of Lenny Moore,"He played with a quiet confidence. Statistically, he had few peers. Even now, almost forty years after his first professional contest, his impressive body has withstood the test of time. He was Marshall Faulk before there was a Marshall Faulk. He could catch, he could run, he could block--he did everything. In his complete autobiography, All Things Being Equal, Hall of Fame running back Lenny Moore shares his entire story. Moore recounts many fascinating life experiences, beginning with his upbringing in a blue-color family of thirteen in Reading, Pennsylvania. He explores his standout, yet challenging time in Happy Valley playing for an already legendary coach in Penn State's Rip Engle, and one in-training--Joe Paterno. He also delves into his professional football career with the Baltimore Colts that saw him reach new heights as the MVP of the NFL in 1964. Throughout his amateur and professional career, Moore's toughest competitor was often racism, which battled Moore tooth for tooth. But, as Moore would learn, life would pose other significant battles once his spikes were hung up. Other immortals who played with him--like Johnny Unitas, Gino Marchetti, and Raymond Berry--would easily transition into life after football. Some became businessmen; others carved a new career path as coaches or general managers--but not Moore. In great detail, he describes his difficulties in shifting from having fame and notoriety to not being able to find employment in the town in which he was once celebrated. But Moore eventually found his calling, working with troubled Maryland juveniles, and establishing the Leslie Moore Schorlarship Foundation benefiting underprivileged youths. Today, he also workstoward finding a cure for Scleroderma, after his son passed away of the disease in 2001. Ultimately, All Things Being Equal is the touching journey of one man's self-discovery that, unfortunately, all things are seldom equal.",1582617813,9781582617817,202,Lenny Moore, , ,4.00,1,0,Sports Publishing LLC,August 1st 2005,Hardcover,English,3708-1345202.All_Things_Being_Equal.html
3001,Autobiography of Samuel S. Hildebrand: The Renowned Missouri Bushwhacker,"Most Civil War historians now agree that the guerrilla conflict shaped the entire war in significant ways. Some of these “bushwhackers”—Nathan Bedford Forrest, William Clarke Quantrill, John Singleton Mosby—have become quite infamous. Illiterate Sam Hildebrand, one of Missouri’s most notorious guerrillas—often compared to “Rob Roy,” and the subject of dime novels—was one of the few to survive the war and have his story taken down and published. Shortly after this he was killed in a barroom brawl. “I make no apology to mankind for my acts of retaliation; I make no whining appeal to the world for sympathy. I sought revenge and I found it; the key of hell was not suffered to rust in the lock while I was on the war path.” —Sam Hildebrand Hildebrand’s reign of terror gave the Union army fits and kept much of the Trans-Mississippi, especially Missouri, roiling in the 1860s. Over seven years of fighting he and his men killed dozens of soldiers and civilians, whites and blacks; he claimed to have killed nearly one hundred himself. He was accused of many heinous acts. The historical significance of Hildebrand’s story is substantial, but his bloody tale is eminently readable and stands quite well on its own as a cold-blooded portrait of a violent time in American history. Like the nightmarish and depraved world of the Kid in Cormac McCarthy’s novel Blood Meridian, Hildebrand’s world is truly ruthless and his story is brutally descriptive in its coolly detached rendering of one man’s personal war. Published in 1870, Hildebrand’s autobiography has long been out of print and has been a rare and highly prized acquisition among Civil War",1557287996,9781557287991,280,Samuel S.

3002,Wonderful Today: The Autobiography of Pattie Boyd,"A Q&A with Pattie Boyd, Author of Wonderful Tonight Why are you writing the book now? I have been asked for the last 15 years to write a book, and it is only now that I feel the time is right. My confidence in myself was restored after two successful exhibitions of my photography, and it occurred to me that I was finally ready to take a look at the unique experiences of my life and to share them--including all the ups and downs. Tell us about the first time you met George Harrison. Working as a model, I occasionally went for castings, mainly for television commercials. I went for an interview with one of the directors I had worked with in the past, and he cast me in his first movie, A Hard Day's Night , to play the part of a schoolgirl. When I first saw George on the set, I thought he was the best-looking man I'd ever seen. I was so surprised when he asked me out on a date at the end of my first day of filming. Tell us about the first time you heard George Harrison's song, ""Something."" George said he had written a song for me, and he played it on the guitar at home without the words. Then when I heard the song after it had been recorded I couldn't believe how utterly beautiful it was. It was released on a single in October 1969, and I felt so thrilled and flattered. Tell us about the first time you heard Eric Clapton's ""Layla."" Eric invited me to his band's flat one day and played a rough recording of ""Layla"" on a cassette recorder. I was sitting on a sofa and he on the floor as it played, and he kept looking up at me for a reaction. I was stunned; the intensity, passion and tenderness came across so strongly--I knew, as he said, it was written for me.",0755316428,9780755316427,0,Pattie Boyd,Penny Junor, ,3.64,7616,804,Headline Review,August 23rd 2007,Hardcover,English,371-1822319.Wonderful_Today.html
3003,American Women's Autobiography: Fea(s)ts of Memory,"This is the first collection of essays to focus exclusively on the contribution of American women to the writing of autobiography. The Authors trace traditions of women's life-writing through three and a half centuries, from the narratives of Puritan women to contemporary multicultural literature. Contributors to the volume are major scholars in their fields: Sidonie Smith, Catharine Stimpson, Ann Gordon, Mary Mason, Nancy Walker, Kathleen Sands, Arlyn Diamond, and others whose essays all appear here for the first time. Reflecting recent theoretical approaches to autobiography, these essays draw upon work in literature, history, American studies, and religion, and treat both canonical writers of autobiography—Harriet Jacobs, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Gertrude Stein, Mary McCarthy, Maxine Hong Kingston, and others—as well as lesser known and unknown writers. Through these lives we glimpse the wider worlds of which they were a part, including the abolition and suffrage movements, western frontier life, and the struggle for civil rights in the twentieth century. In her introduction, Margo Culley traces the dominant tradition of American women's autobiography back to the Puritan practice of ""reading the self."" Writing as women and expecting to be judged as such, authors from all periods exhibit ambivalence about the first person singular, yet give themselves ""permission"" to write in the hope that their stories will be useful to others, particularly other women. Such purpose allows these writers to indulge all the pleasures of autobiography—pleasures of language and imagination, of narrative, of reminiscence, and even egotism. Together these essays explore gender and genre as culturally inscribed, the construction of self within language systems, the nature of female subjectivity, and the shaping forces of memory and narrative as writers engage in the making of meaning and the making of history. Grounded in the multicultural reality that is America, these essays celebrate women's lives, women's autobiographical writing (including criticism), and the fea(s)ts of reading women's writing.",0299132943,9780299132941,352,Margo Culley, , ,4.00,1,0,University of Wisconsin Press,October 15th 1992,Paperback,English,3710-1476072.American_Women_s_Autobiography.html

3005,The Autobiography of Ozaki Yukio: The Struggle for Constitutional Government in Japan,"Ozaki Yukio, who was returned to his seat in the Japanese Diet twenty-five times, served in that body from its inception in 1890 to 1953. He was several times a cabinet member and, for ten years, mayor of Tokyo. A strong advocate of representative government, he both witnessed and propelled Japan's transformation from a late feudal society to a modern state. His autobiography, available in English for the first time, gives an insider's account of key episodes and leaders over seven decades of Japanese history. Ozaki's political life spanned the Meiji rise to power and Japan's defeat in World War II, and he played a significant role in each phase of that epic. As a young reporter, he gained preeminence with incisive calls for supremacy in East Asia. A European trip that showed him the devastation of World War I converted him to advocacy of arms reduction and international cooperation. He watched with dismay as Japan encountered isolation and military disaster. Known for the courage of his convictions, he became a marked man, carrying a death poem in his pocket. His sturdy independence survived the American Occupation, as he deplored his associates' readiness to heed occupation dictates. Ozaki's story reverberates with the immediacy of his personal knowledge of every major Japanese political figure for three-quarters of a century. It is the account of a man who made history as well as writing it. His story is the story of modern Japan. Through it, readers will gain first-hand knowledge of Japanese constitutional history, one with rich relevance for contemporary Japanese politics.",0691050953,9780691050959,480,Yukio Ozaki,Yukio Ozaki, ,3.50,2,0,Princeton University Press,April 9th 2001,Hardcover,English,3712-1399458.The_Autobiography_of_Ozaki_Yukio.html

3010,Uwe Rosler - My Autobiography: Knocking Down Walls,"Uwe Rosler's passion and determination is never far from the surface, and it's that drive that changed the path he seemed set to follow. Destined for an unremarkable career in East Germany, where the Berlin Wall presented a greater mental boundary than the bricks and mortar that formed the physical division between two different worlds, Uwe was 25 and heading nowhere. Then, a chance for the raw talent that had been contained in his repressive surrounds was to be set loose, as he was offered the chance of a loan at struggling English Premier League club, Manchester City. The contrast between 'Madchester' and his homeland could not have been more marked. The mullet-haired striker was an instant hit, his goals helping City survive relegation and winning him a permanent deal. Voted Player of the Year in his first full season in England, over the next four years Rosler wrote his name into City folklore and became a terrace idol. The fans loved his raw passion, commitment and the fact he wore his heart on his sleeve - that, plus his goals. However, once he fell out with boss Alan Ball, there was only going to be one winner. For three successive years he finished top scorer, and stayed with City when they were relegated. Unfortunately another relegation resulted in severe cut-backs and he had to move on, initially returning to Germany and a first stint in the Bundesliga with Kaiserslautern. He soon returned to England with Southampton before a spell with West Bromwich Albion brought an end to his playing days in a country he called his second home. He finished his playing career with Norwegian side Lillestrom, where he soon faced a bigger battle than anything he'd faced in football. Diagnosed with chest cancer, Uwe was forced to reassess his life and ambitions as he began receiving treatment. Was it time to leave the game if the chemotherapy was successful? Lifted by an incredible show of affection from the City fans, who he listened to on a mobile phone singing his name during a home game while stricken in hospital, Rosler made a remarkable recovery. After being given a clean bill of health, he moved into management with Lillestrom. He remained there for two years, then enhanced his reputation further with Viking, where he remained for four years. He then had a short spell with Molde, saving the club from relegation before being replaced by returning superstar Ole Gunnar Solkjaer. Undeterred, Uwe decided to try his hand in England, where he had recently been voted into the Manchester City Hall of Fame. Brentford offered him that chance - and he immediately made an impact. He guided the Bees to their highest finish in six years in his first season, then came within a coat of paint of guiding his side to promotion a year later - only to see his dream turn to dust in a matter of 30 crazy seconds on the final day of the 2012/13 campaign. No matter. His dream is to manage in the Premier League, and Uwe will keep going until he succeeds. There's not been a wall built yet he hasn't scaled and almost 15 years since he left City, the fans still regularly sing his name. Now read his fascinating life story -",1908695226,9781908695222,288,Uwe Rosler, , ,3.00,2,1,Trinity Mirror Sport Media,October 31st 2013,Hardcover,English,3717-18817108-uwe-rosler---my-autobiography.html

3018,THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A PING PONG BALL: MY LIFE WITH ADHD,"It has been estimated that between one and seven percent of children and between two and five percent of adults live with the medical neurological disorder known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although ADHD is thought to be genetic in origin, its precise cause is currently unknown. Typical symptoms for children and adolescents with ADHD include inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Because they are easily distracted and have trouble focusing in school, children with ADHD often have difficulty paying attention, following instructions and completing assignments. Their hyperactivity is often displayed in non-stop motion and constant talking. Their impulsivity and impatience lead to blurting out inappropriate comments and an inability to wait and take turns. These behaviors can contribute to conflicts with friends and classmates and ongoing frustration for parents and other caregivers. About one-third to one-half of patients diagnosed with ADHD as children continue to demonstrate symptoms into adulthood, including disorganization in their work and personal lives, relationship problems, and drug and alcohol abuse. Ongoing impulsiveness and restlessness can lead to frequent job changes. The majority of articles and books about ADHD focus on children and are written for parents or professionals working in the field. Far fewer deal with adult ADHD, and only a handful are autobiographies written by adults who are living with the condition. This book is part of that handful. Although the behaviors associated with ADHD have been documented for centuries, they were generally viewed in moralistic terms, as willful misbehavior deserving punishment, or as a form of mental illness Acknowledgement of a distinct medical condition is relatively recent. The term “hyperkinetic syndrome” emerged in the late 1950s, and medications like Ritalin were prescribed. The term “Attention deficit disorder” (ADD) began to be used in 1980, and the broader term “attention deficit hyperactivity disorder” (ADHD) emerged in 1987 and has gradually eliminated the use of “ADD” to describe the condition. Larry Lee was born in 1941, but he wasn’t diagnosed with ADHD until the early 1980s when he was over 40 years of age. This is the Larry Lee’s story, which he finished writing when he was 74 years old. Other than some editing for length and clarity, it is told in his own words and in his own way.",, ,203,Larry Lee,Russ Gourluck,Mike Theuer,3.00,1,0, , ,Kindle Edition,,3724-25747800-the-autobiography-of-a-ping-pong-ball.html

A group of late-medieval authors, Thomas Usk, James I of Scotland, Charles d'Orleans, George Ashby, William Thorpe, Richard Wyche, and Sir Thomas Malory, demonstrate the ways in which the imprisoned writer is presented, both within and outside the Boethian tradition.

This Library of America collection of Franklin's works begins with letters sent from London (1757–1775) describing the events and diplomacy preceding the Revolutionary War. The volume also contains political satires, bagatelles, pamphlets, and letters written in Paris (1776–1785), where he represented the revolutionary United States at the court of Louis XVI, as well as his speeches given in the Constitutional Convention and other works written in Philadelphia (1785–1790), including his last published article, a searing satire against slavery. Also included are the delightfully shrewd prefaces to Poor Richard's Almanack (1733–1758) and their worldly, pungent maxims that have entered our American culture. Finally, the classic Autobiography, Franklin's last word on his greatest literary creation—his own invented personality—is presented here in a new edition, completely faithful to Franklin's manuscript.

One, of renowned heart surgeon Alfred Blalock, speaks for itself. The other, of highschool graduate Vivien Thomas, is testimony to the incredible genius and determination of the first black man to hold a professional position at one of America's premier medical institutions. Thomas's dreams of attending medical school were dashed when the Depression hit. After spending some time as a carpenter's apprentice, Thomas took what he expected to be a temporary job as a technician in Blalock's lab. The two men soon became partners and together invented the field of cardiac surgery. Partners of the Heart is Thomas's extraordinary autobiography. Trained in laboratory techniques by Alfred Blalock and Joseph W. Beard, Thomas remained Blalock's principal technician and laboratory chief for the rest of Blalock's distinguished career. Thomas very rapidly learned to perform surgery, to do chemical determinations, and to carry out physiologic studies.

The work, chronicled in his new autobiography, ""Too Much Is Never Enough"", is a testament to his roots in set and costume design for theater and to the glamour he brought to the most basic buildings and interiors. In an age when appropriation was not the rage, Lapidus pioneered this signature element of post-modernism, combining details of French Provincial and Italian Romanesque architecture with whimsical ornament and an unrestrained use of color.

3035,Margot Fonteyn: Autobiography,"Her book is herself. It is, of course, about dancing. About loving to dance as a small child in Shanghai. About ballet classes and ballet teachers, about practice and rehearsal. About making her debut--as a Snowflake, at fifteen--with the emerging Sadler's Wells Company, under the demanding rule of the brilliant and volatile Ninette de Valois. About her almost magical early success (at seventeen dancing Giselle ; at eighteen, Swan Lake ; at nineteen, Sleeping Beauty ) and the effects on a young girl of sudden stardom. About the hard work of overcoming her limitations (""a face like a pudding,"" she says) and her weaknesses.... And it is about the great triumphs in London, New York, Paris. About the great choreographers and dancers who worked with her and helped her: Frederick Ashton (he choreographed by flinging himself into swoops and twists that seemed to flow spontaneously from the music, suddenly saying, ""What did I do? Now you do it""); the magnetic and sophisticated Robert Helpmann, of whom she was more than a little frightened ""until the harmony of dancing with him began taking hold""; the handsome Michael Somes (""platoons of corps de ballet girls lost their hearts to him""). About Nureyev, who, when Fonteyn was already in her forties, galvanized her energies and talents and swept her into a new career. About her feeling for her great Russian counterpart, Ulanova. About getting older and never ceasing to dance; now, at fifty-seven, still dancing around the world. But even more, this is a book about the woman herself, who sees dancing as only a part of her life and perhaps not the most vital part--the Fonteyn who could not find love until in her thirties she suddenly met again (a visiting card brought to her dressing room; one hundred red roses) the man she had been in love with in her teens, the Panamanian diplomat Roberto Arias. And here is the infinitely moving story of their marriage, her shy assumption of her new role as ambassadress at the Court of St. James--and then, the near-fatal shooting in Panama that crippled her husband, and the drama and heroism of their life together since then. Throughout, with the freshest imaginable gift for anecdote, Margot Fonteyn takes us into her many worlds--the vicissitudes of backstage life on six continents, the tumult of Panamanian politics and revolution, the social pleasures (and embarrassments) of international fame. Above all, her autobiography is a revelation of a direct, warm-hearted person who believes that artists must take their art altogether seriously--and themselves not seriously at all; who finds her own fame difficult to grasp; who is worthy of what her audiences feel for her. Fonteyn is not only admired but loved. Her book--in its decency, its generosity, its sense of fun--makes clear why.",044681380X,9780446813808,0,Margot Fonteyn, , ,3.82,88,10,Warner Books (NY),February 1st 1977,Paperback,English,374-35706.Margot_Fonteyn.html

3042,The Power of Indignation: The Autobiography of the Man Who Inspired the Arab Spring,"His brief pamphlet Indignez-vous! ( Cry Out! ) is an international bestseller, calling for a return to the values of his native France’s “greatest generation,” the resistance fighters of World War II. It has inspired citizens participating in the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street uprisings. Now Stéphane Hessel, one of France’s preeminent thinkers and activists, is back. With extraordinary insight, the ninety-four-year-old Hessel gives his intellectual autobiography. His thinking is nourished by the exchange he has maintained for years with his close friends, as well as prominent political and literary figures: Edgar Morin, Jean-Paul Dollé, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Régis Debray, Peter Sloterdijk, Laure Adler, Michel Rocard, and Jean-Claude Carrière. This book is accessible and profound—it is for all those who seek, despite the contradictions and violence of our contemporary lives, to “regain our dignity as men and women while governed by a frenzy of selfish and irresponsible people.” This book is, for Stéphane Hessel, a way to encourage us to reflect on the past in order to take charge of our future destiny. At once a handbook for the revolutionary, a treatise on human rights, and an inside look at the relationships, thoughts, and recollections of one of the most important figures in France today, this is a not-to-be-missed book for 2012.",1620870924,9781620870921,272,Stéphane Hessel,E.C.

3043,Reading Arab Women's Autobiographies: Shahrazad Tells Her Story,"Authors of autobiographies are always engaged in creating a ""self"" to present to their readers. This process of self-creation raises a number of intriguing questions: why and how does anyone choose to present herself or himself in an autobiography? Do women and men represent themselves in different ways and, if so, why? How do differences in culture affect the writing of autobiography in various parts of the world? This book tackles these questions through a close examination of Arab women's autobiographical writings. Nawar Al-Hassan Golley applies a variety of western critical theories, including Marxism, colonial discourse, feminism, and narrative theory, to the autobiographies of Huda Shaarawi, Fadwa Tuqan, Nawal el-Saadawi, and others to demonstrate what these critical methodologies can reveal about Arab women's writing. At the same time, she also interrogates these theories against the chosen texts to see how adequate or appropriate these models are for analyzing texts from other cultures. This two-fold investigation sheds important new light on how the writers or editors of Arab women's autobiographies have written, documented, presented, and organized their texts.",029270545X,9780292705456,236,Nawar Al-Hassan Golley, , ,2.67,3,0,University of Texas Press,November 1st 2003,Paperback,English,3747-4171080-reading-arab-women-s-autobiographies.html

Touted as a great artist cut off in his prime, his mysterious death in Canoe Lake, Algonquin Park, and the controversy about his final resting-place fired the popular imagination and raised him to the status of a national hero. In Inventing Tom Thomson Sherrill Grace examines many of the ways in which the figure of Thomson has been imagined by Canadians. Even people who do not know his paintings well will recognize The Jack Pine and know his legend through the marketing of Thomson memorabilia on the Web, in museums, and in stores.",0773527524,9780773527522,248,Sherrill Grace, , ,3.67,6,0,"McGill-Queen's University Press          ""]",November 4th 2004,Hardcover,English,3748-2289028.Inventing_Tom_Thomson.html
3045,Apparitions of the Self: The Secret Autobiographies of a Tibetan Visionary- A Translation and Study of Jigme Lingpa's Dancing Moon in the Water and Dakki's Grand Secret Talk,"Apparitions of the Self is a groundbreaking investigation into what is known in Tibet as ""secret autobiography,"" an exceptional, rarely studied literary genre that presents a personal exploration of intimate religious experiences. In this volume, Janet Gyatso translates and studies the outstanding pair of secret autobiographies by the famed Tibetan Buddhist visionary, Jigme Lingpa (1730-1798), whose poetic and self-conscious writings are as much about the nature of his own identity, memory, and the undecidabilities of autobiographical truth as they are narrations of the actual content of his experiences. Their translation in this book marks the first time that works of this sort have been translated in a Western language. Gyatso is among the first to consider Tibetan literature from a comparative perspective, examining the surprising fit--as well as the misfit--of Western literary theory with Tibetan autobiography. She examines the intriguing questions of why Tibetan Buddhists produced so many autobiographies (far more than other Asian Buddhists) and how autobiographical self-assertion is possible even while Buddhists believe that the self is ultimately an illusion. Also explored are Jigme Lingpa's historical milieu, his revelatory visions of the ancient Tibetan dynasty, and his meditative practices of personal cultivation. The book concludes with a study of the subversive female figure of the ""Dakini"" in Jigme Lingpa's writings, and the implications of her gender, her sexuality, and her unsettling discourse for the autobiographical subject in Tibet.",0691009481,9780691009483,384,Jigme Lingpa,Janet Gyatso, ,4.12,16,0,Princeton University Press,November 1st 1999,Paperback,English,3749-505866.Apparitions_of_the_Self.html
3046,The Autobiography of Saint Therese: The Story of a Soul,"Few spiritual figures have touched as many readers in the past century as Saint Therese of Lisieux, the saint popularly known as the Little Flower. Though she was only twenty-four years old when she died, her writings have had tremendous impact, making her one of the most popular spiritual writers in the twentieth century. Her autobiography, The Story of a Soul , has been a source of priceless inspiration ever since it was written, and has become the great spiritual bestseller of our time. A hundred years after her death in 1897, millions of copies have spread throughout the world and it has been translated into more than fifty languages. The reason for the continued success of her autobiography is, quite simply, that it is unlike any work of devotion and spiritual insight ever written. Once it is read, it cannot be forgotten. Its appeal across cultures and generations has been extensive, moving both peasants and popes, men and women, young and old -- people of every kind of intelligence and education succumb to its spell. Yet is not a conventional work of religious devotion; instead, it is in many ways a supernatural book. In the words of Pope Pius XI, Saint Therese ""attained the knowledge of supernatural things in such abundant measure that she was able to point out the sure way of salvation to others,"" and it is especially in The Story of a Soul that she has pointed out this sure way to the generations that have followed her. As Therese herself said of this book just prior to her death, ""What I have written will do a lot of good. It will make the kindness of God better known.""",0307778088,9780307778086,192,John Beevers, , ,4.42,156,19,Image,January 26th 2011,ebook,English,375-10301485-the-autobiography-of-saint-therese.html

3056,Raga Mala: The Autobiography of Ravi Shankar,"Shankar, a sitar player known as the godfather of world music for his role in opening Western ears to sounds from the East, gives an honest, in-depth look at his life and work in this prodigious autobiography. Like a fine musical composition, Shankar beautifully narrates his life's milestones--his early years in India, his travels as a performer in Paris during the 1930s, his breakthrough in the West and rise to stardom during the '60s, his turbulent personal life in the '70s and '80s--while periodically returning to his basic theme: his love of music and the sitar. Throughout, Shankar builds on his 1968 book, My Music, My Life, which provided a general introduction to Indian music. He describes his performances in U.S. music festivals (Woodstock, he says, was "" a terrifying experience"" where ""the music was incidental""); he also weaves in tales of people he affected (Gene Kelly, Richard Burton, Peter Sellers, Marlon Brando and, of course, editor Harrison), and those who influenced him--most importantly Ustad Allauddin Khan, the classical musician and pioneer of modern Hindustani instrumental music. Along with the enormous number of photographs that accompany this dense and lengthy work, Shankar presents letters and musical transcriptions to produce a history of Indian music during the 20th century. Although Shankar has been somewhat taken for granted in recent years due to his long-standing popularity, this book convincingly reasserts his historical importance.",1566491045,9781566491044,236,Ravi Shankar,George Harrison,Oliver Craske,4.11,46,9,Welcome Rain,October 1st 1999,Hardcover,English,3759-775774.Raga_Mala.html

3059,My Fight For Irish Freedom: Dan Breen's Autobiography,"The story of the man who fired the first shot in the War of Independence, leader of the 3rd Tipperary Brigade. In 1919 a group of young men barely out of their teens, poorly armed, with no money and little training, renewed the fight, begun in 1916, to drive the British out of Ireland. Dan Breen was to become the best known of them. At first they were condemed on all sides. They became outlaws and My Fight for Irish Freedom describes graphically what life was like 'on the run,' with 'an army at one's heels and a thousand pounds on one's head'. A burning belief in their cause sustained them through many a dark and bitter day and slowly support came from the people. Dan Breen is widely recognised because of his involvement in the ambush and killing of two RIC policemen at Soloheadbeg - a political and historical controversy widely regarded as the act that started the War of Independence. Alongside his comrades in the Third Tipperary Brigade of the IRA, Dan Breen became one of the most infamous and controversial IRA leaders of his generation. With the Civil War over, Breen went to prohibition America, and ran a speakeasy. He returned to Ireland to become a politician, and was the first Republican to enter the Free State parliament.

3067,Tony Brooks: Poetry in Motion: Autobiography of a supreme Grand Prix driver,"It has taken 15 years of relentless persuasion to convince Tony Brooks that he should write his autobiography. In the 1950s he revealed himself to be one of Britain's foremost grand prix drivers, yet throughout his career he shunned publicity, preferring to let his on-track performances speak for themselves. This is why Sir Stirling Moss, on many occasions his team-mate in Formula One and sports car races, has described him as ""the greatest 'little known' driver of all time"". His motor racing career began at Goodwood in 1952 at the wheel of his mother's Healey Silverstone sports car. Three years later, having never previously sat in a Formula One car, he drove a Connaught to victory in the Syracuse Grand Prix, beating the entire Maserati works team at a time when the Italians dominated the sport; it was the first GP victory for a British car and driver for 31 years. Tony's unique combination of speed and smoothness, which has inspired his choice of Poetry in Motion as the title of his book, was to lead to works drives with Aston Martin, BRM, Vanwall and Ferrari, bringing him Grand Prix and sports car victories on Europe's three most challenging circuits ? Spa-Francorchamps, the Nürburgring and Monza. Through his extensive autobiography, he explores in great detail the fundamental differences between the hazardous sport of motor racing in his day with the safety and electronically aided business environment in which Formula One operates today. From an era when death on the track was all too commonplace, he survived two major accidents to complete a career trilogy embracing dentistry, motor racing and the motor business. Now retired, he retains strong links with the sport and is frequently to be seen at major events which honour the history of the sport and its participants.",1899870830,9781899870837,276,Tony Brooks, , ,4.33,3,1,Motor Racing Publications,May 1st 2012,Hardcover,English,3769-13435667-tony-brooks.html

Completed shortly before his death in 1979, Treasure in Clay is the autobiography of Fulton J. Sheen, the preeminent teacher, preacher, and pastor of American Catholicism. Called “the Great Communicator” by Billy Graham and “a prophet of the times” by Pope Pius XII, Sheen was the voice of American Catholicism for nearly fifty years. In addition to his prolific writings, Sheen dominated the airwaves, first in radio, and later television, with his signature program “Life is Worth Living,” drawing an average of 30 million viewers a week in the 1950s. Sheen had the ears of everyone from presidents to the common men, women, and children in the pews, and his uplifting message of faith, hope, and love shaped generations of Catholics. Here in Sheen’s own words are reflections from his childhood, his years in seminary, his academic career, his media stardom, his pastoral work, his extensive travels, and much more.

During the early years in Alert Bay, Sewid was torn between validating his chieftainships by giving potlatches, as tradition demanded, and obeying the law which prohibited them. As these laws changed, he became active in reviving Kwakiutl traditions and, in 1955, he was selected by the National Film Board of Canada to portray many of his achievements in a film called No Longer Vanishing. In this book Sewid tells of his work for the Native Brotherhood of British Columbia and of his activities as Chief. He describes developments which he initiated to revive Kwakiutl arts and outlines economic institutions which he created to improve Kwakiutl living standards. His story offers many insights into life in a non-Western society undergoing rapid change and provides an excellent study of an individual who adapted successfully to these changes. James Spradley carefully analyzes Sewid's style of adaptation and concludes with a study of the social and psychological conditions which enabled him to become a leader, innovator, and multicultural individual.",0773501347,9780773501348,336,James Sewid,James Sewid, ,3.80,5,0,McGill-Queen's University Press,May 27th 1995,Paperback,English,3775-318747.Guests_Never_Leave_Hungry.html

Chosen from over two hundred entries, and translated from Yiddish, the nine life stories in My Future Is in America provide a compelling portrait of American Jewish life in the immigrant generation at the turn of the twentieth century.

They include manual workers, shopkeepers, housewives, communal activists, and professionals who came from all parts of Eastern Europe and ushered in a new era in American Jewish history. In their own words, the immigrant writers convey the complexities of the transition between the Old and New Worlds. An Introduction places the writings in historical and literary context, and annotations explain historical and cultural allusions made by the writers.

We couldn't face the disapproval.' Sue Johnston always seemed to be disappointing her mother. As a girl she never stayed clean and tidy like her cousins. As she grew older, she spent all her piano lesson money on drinks for her mates down the pub, and when she discovered the Cavern she was never at home. The final straw was when Sue left her steady job at a St. Helens factory to try her hand at the unsteadiest of jobs: acting. Yet when Sue was bringing up her own child alone, her mother was always there to help. And playing her much-loved characters Sheila Grant and Barbara Royle - although her mum wouldn't say she was proud as such, she certainly seemed to approve. And in her mother's final months, it was Sue she needed by her side. The relationship with your mother is perhaps the most precious and fraught of any woman's life. When she began writing, Sue set out to record, ""All the big things, and all the small things. Everything I wanted to tell my mother but felt I never could."" The result is a warm, poignant, and often very funny memoir by one of our favorite actresses.",0091938899,9780091938895,352,Sue Johnston, , ,3.73,109,18,Ebury Press,September 1st 2011,Hardcover,English,3778-12507992-things-i-couldn-t-tell-my-mother.html

3079,Enough about You: Adventures in Autobiography,"""Enough About You"" is a book about David Shields. But it is also a terrifically engrossing exploration and exploitation of self-reflection, self-absorption, full-blown narcissism, and the impulse to write about oneself. In a world awash with memoirs and tell-alls, Shields has created something unique: he invites the reader into his mind as he turns his life into a narrative. With moving and often hilarious candor, Shields ruminates on a variety of subjects, all while exploring the impulse to confess, to use oneself as an autobiographical subject, to make one's life into a work of art. Shields explores the connections between fiction and nonfiction, stuttering and writing, literary forms and literary contents, art and life; he confronts bad reviews of his earlier books; he examines why he read a college girlfriend's journal; he raids a wide range of cultural figures (from Rousseau, Nabokov, and Salinger to Bill Murray, Adam Sandler, and Bobby Knight) for what they have to tell him about himself; he quotes a speech he wrote on the occasion of his father's ninetieth birthday and then gives us the guilt-induced dream he had when he failed to deliver the speech; he also writes about basketball and sexuality and Los Angeles and Seattle, but he is always meditating on the origins of his interest in autobiography, on the limits and appeals of autobiography, on the traps and strategies of it, and finally, how to use it to get to the world. The result is a collection of poetically charged self-reflections that reveal deep truths about ourselves as well.",0743225783,9780743225786,192,David Shields, , ,3.21,136,24,Simon & Schuster,April 23rd 2002,Hardcover,English,378-345822.Enough_about_You.html

3084,The Brothers: An Autobiography,"After decades as cult musicians, New Orleans's Neville Brothers spent the '90s solidifying their position as a minor American institution. Torchbearers for both tight, lean funk (Art and Cyril were key players in the profoundly influential '70s combo the Meters) and soul-gripping balladry (Aaron scored a 1966 No. 2 hit with ""Tell It Like It Is"" before resurfacing as a solo and group star in the late '80s), the Neville Brothers band has found a diverse audience with open ears for its message of rhythm and community. Before that happened, though, the brothers lived thug life as hard as Tupac Shakur ever did. Open the first two-thirds of this oral history to any random page, and you'll find rhapsodies about musicians as far afield as Professor Longhair, Ellis Marsalis, and Billy Stewart--or something quite a bit darker, like Cyril's remembrance of a near deadly razor fight: ""I'm bleeding like a hog.... [T]hey needed 180 stitches to sew my neck together... [and] some Demerol to get me even higher and let me go back to the gig--the same night--where I carried on, singing 'Cold Sweat' and 'Heard It Through the Grapevine' as though the shit had never happened."" Vividly told by the Nevilles and smartly organized by Ray Charles and Marvin Gaye biographer David Ritz, this is a resounding look at how these musicians put drugs, violence, and industry troubles behind them to become a veteran touring act and Grammy machine. If not quite the equal of drummer (and fellow New Orleanian) Earl Palmer's Backbeat , this is a fine, often chilling look both back and forward. --Rickey Wright",, ,352,Art Neville,Aaron Neville,Charles Neville,3.95,43,8,Da Capo,2001,Paperback,English,3784-15710306-the-brothers.html

3096,In the Corridors of Power: An Autobiography,"A political adviser to the formidably intellectual Foreign Secretary Tony Crosland and to Prime Minister Jim Callaghan, and a senior journalist at The Times and The Economist, David Lipsey has been close to the heart of government for more than four decades. Providing a unique perspective on a period of great economic and political upheaval, In the Corridors of Power details such flashpoints as the 1976-77 IMF crisis, which saw Britain under a divided government hovering on the edge of national bankruptcy, and reveals why Jim Callaghan ducked an election in 1978 - and led Labour to disastrous defeat in 1979. But Lipsey is no one-dimensional policy nerd. Here we see a man who moves easily from the rarefied atmosphere at the core of government to the more down-to-earth pleasures of the greyhound track and the racecourse betting ring, while his enthusiasm for harness racing is such that he has regularly competed in the sport. It is often said that the very best political books come from those who observe from behind the scenes, rather than from the politicians in the front line. Here is a classic of the genre.",1849544298,9781849544290,228,David Lipsey, , ,4.00,1,0,Biteback Publishing,June 1st 2012,ebook, ,3795-16621184-in-the-corridors-of-power.html

This recounts her childhood as she came of age in Germany under Hitler's growing power. The granddaughter of a prominent member of the local Jewish community, and part of a close-knit and loving family, she was not only academically gifted, but also a natural poet. Still, as the youngest of three sisters, she thought of herself as a lesser child. The book is more than just an account of Gershon's childhood. She illuminates the period leading up to the Holocaust, showing how Jewish families were trapped into becoming victims, while the German people were gradually conditioned to condone it. She vividly recreates the atmosphere of the period, and her analysis of her family's psychology is beautifully and convincingly told.",0720608996,9780720608991,198,Karen Gershon, , ,3.00,1,0,Peter Owen Publishers,June 1st 1994,Hardcover,English,3806-1816978.A_Lesser_Child.html

How he achieved this prominence is an unceasingly entertaining narrative: his difficult relationship with his father; his education first at a public school with the Dickensian name of Downside and then at post-Brideshead Oxford; his National Service in the army, during which he severely wounded himself with a machine gun; and his early career as a novelist and then as a Fleet Street journalist and columnist for the notorious, libelous Private Eye.

3131,An Autobiography of a Self-Exorcist,"An Autobiography of a Self-Exorcist is an amazing journey of self-discovery and raw exposure - a soul redemption for the whole world to watch in its divine revelation. Each word captured my mind, searching for the meaning of each step of Khahliso's Matela oa Sekoli's sacred life-path, moving through the experience with him, but also within myself. This story inspires each one of us to confess our own transgressions, both the self-inflicted and those waged upon others as we engage in the sort of restorative self-analyses expressed so poetically by Matela's own inner discourse. This is a read for one to experience in a place of quiet reflection where he or she can have genuine discussions with the soul without the interference of untruths that many of us convey to our mirrors and our associates on a daily basis. I celebrate his honesty, his exorcism, his renewal and his future; you will travel along his rite of passage from the ""land of metaphors"" to the ""lands of the flute-speakers"" experiencing the inevitable pain of evolution, but ultimately leaving you ""mesmerized by the song of new waters.""

3134,Proud: My Autobiography,"**Shortlisted for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award 2014** Gareth Thomas had it all. He was a national hero, a sporting icon. He was a leader of men, captain of Wales and the British Lions. To him, rugby was an expression of cultural identity, a sacred code. It was no mere ball game. It gave him everything, except the freedom to be himself. This is the story of a man with a secret that was slowly killing him. Something that might devastate not only his own life but the lives of his wife, family, friends and teammates. The only place where he could find any refuge from the pain and guilt of the lie he was living was on the pitch, playing the sport he loved. But all his success didn’t make the strain of hiding who he really was go away. His fear that telling the truth about his sexuality would lose him everything he loved almost sent him over the edge. The deceit ended when Gareth became the world’s most prominent athlete to come out as a gay man. His gesture has strengthened strangers, and given him a fresh perspective. Gareth’s inspiring and moving story transcends the world of sport to tell a universal truth about feeling like an outsider, and facing up to who you really are.",, ,320,Gareth Thomas, , ,3.97,102,20,Ebury Digital,September 11th 2014,Kindle Edition,English,383-23253191-proud.html
3135,De Quincey's Art Of Autobiography,"Covering all the major themes of Thomas De Quincey's prose work, this new study argues the case for acknowledging ""the Opium Eater"" as a conscious artist, not the ""flawed"" writer often portrayed in previous critical studies. The book analyzes in detail the various manifestations of De Quincey's writings-autobiography, biography, fiction, politics, and political economy-relating them to the central concern of his work, the production of the self. By deconstructing De Quincey's working methods the book shows how De Quincey's constant revisions and recurrent tropes reflect his self-conscious purpose. Reference is made to many neglected writings, including letters, a newly discovered fiction, and previously ""lost"" work, to help illustrate the book's argument that De Quincey's oeuvre is primarily autobiographical. Contents: Acknowledgements; Bibliographical Note and Short Titles List; Introduction; Confessions of an English Opium-Eater; Autobiographical Essays; Biographical Interventions: sketches of Coleridge and Wordsworth; and Sir Hamilton; Fictions; 'The English Mail-Coach' and De Quincey's political works; The Logic of Political EconomyàR and related works; Notes; Bibliography; IndexàR",0748601384,9780748601387,218,Edmund Baxter, , ,0.00,0,0,Edinburgh University Press,January 1st 1990,Unknown Binding,English,3830-4468557-de-quincey-s-art-of-autobiography.html
3136,A Clip of Steel: A Picaresque Autobiography,"A Clip of Steel was first published in 1969, when Thomas Blackburn was fifty-three years old. He had often explored the traumas of his childhood and early life in his poetry, but in this memoir he tells the story in its terrifying entirety. He called the work ‘a picaresque autobiography’ and in a writing style that races you through the pages, he confronts his own and his family's demons with humour, compassion and not a trace of self-pity. By the end of the book he seems to have more or less survived the experience of growing up, while we, his readers, emerge wide-eyed with incredulity, blinking into the ordinary daylight of our lives. This edition includes a new introduction by the author's daughter, Julia Blackburn. ‘The poet Thomas Blackburn faced his inner darkness with a savage courage and wrote exquisite poetry exploring the demons which haunted him. This memoir is painfully honest about those demons, yet it also reveals Thomas Blackburn as a master of prose. A Clip of Steel is one of the great literary memoirs of the 20th century.’ – Bernard Cornwell ‘A fascinating contribution to the genre of father-son memoirs that stretches from Edmund Gosse to Philip Roth: wry, candid, and at times hilarious, even when the subject matter (racial prejudice, sexual repression, alcoholism and mental breakdown) is at its toughest.’ – Blake Morrison, author of And When Did You Last See Your Father? ‘A lot of it is funny and some of it terrifying.

3144,To Comfort Always: An Autobiography,"Coming from a long line of doctors, it seemed natural that Edward Livingston Trudeau would follow in that path. Never did he dream that only shortly after returning from his honeymoon in 1871, he would be diagnosed with tuberculosis. Despite being devastated by the news, he spent the rest of his life in the research and treatment of tuberculosis, establishing the Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium at Saranac Lake. His laboratory there was the first in the United States dedicated to a better understanding of the disease. In this intensely interesting, inspiring, and often witty memoir, Dr. Trudeau relates the trials and victories of his professional and personal life. He long marriage was one of the bedrocks of his life. Among his most celebrated patients was author Robert Louis Stevenson, with whom he became friends. He also mentions an evening with Stevenson and Libby Custer (widow of General George Custer) that was highly entertaining. As for living a life with illness, Trudeau says: ""I have had ample opportunity in the past forty years to get used to illness and suffering; but it took me a long time to learn, imperfectly though it be, that acquiescence is the only way for the tuberculous invalid to conquer fate. To cease to rebel and struggle, and to learn to be content with part of a loaf when one cannot have a whole loaf, though a hard lesson to learn, is good philosophy for the tuberculous invalid, and to his astonishment he often finds that what he considers the half-loaf, when acquiesced in, proves most satisfying.""

3160,NIVEDAN: The Autobiography of Dharmanand Kosambi,"The autobiography of Dharmanand Kosambi (1876–1947), pioneering scholar of Pali and Buddhist Studies, is one of the most moving and spellbinding life stories ever written. Born in rural Goa, Dharmanand came under the spell of the Buddha’s teachings during his adolescence. At an early age he set off on an incredible journey of austere self-training across the length and breadth of Britain’s Indian Empire, halting to educate himself at places connected with Buddhism. His sojourns included living in Sri Lanka to master Pali, in a Burmese cave as a bhikshu, and in some viharas of North India—begging for monastic sustenance—as well as in Nepal and Sikkim which he reached after arduous, sometimes barefoot, treks. Over these itinerant years Dharmanand acquired such mastery of the Buddhist canon that he was variously appointed to teach and research at Calcutta, Baroda, Harvard, and Leningrad. As a thinker Dharmanand blended Buddhist ethics, Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of truth and non-violence, and the ideals of socialism. He exchanged letters with the Mahatma, worked for his causes, and died in the approved Buddhist/Jain manner by voluntary starvation at Sevagram ashram. Arguably, no Indian scholar’s life has been as exemplary as Dharmanand’s, or has approximated as closely to the nobility and saintliness of the Mahatma’s. Meera Kosambi’s Introduction contextualizes the life, career, and achievement of one of modern India’s greatest scholar-savants.",, ,212,Meera Kosambi, , ,3.00,1,0,Permanent Black,November 19th 2012,Kindle Edition,English,3853-21184976-nivedan.html

By the time Jack was 16, he was addicted to alcohol and prescription drugs, was hanging out with rock stars in LA and living a life that any teenager would aspire to—and then the reality show The Osbournes turned him into a global celebrity. As much as Jack enjoyed his fame, underneath it all he was still an awkward teenager, using his sense of humor as a protective shield. With fame and money came greater access to drugs and soon his addictions took a firmer hold on him and his behavior was soon out of control. In 21 Years Gone Jack writes with brutal frankness about his descent into addiction and the low point he reached when his mother Sharon was diagnosed with cancer. Scared that his she might die, Jack retreated further into his alcoholic shell, hating who he was, hating what he did. When Sharon realized what was happening she told Jack he had to go into rehab and slowly he turned his life around. Discovering a passion for extreme sports, he went from overweight and unfit to the lean young man he is today—courtesy of such adventures as running with the bulls in Pamplona, fighting a Thai martial arts expert, and scaling El Capitan, one of the world's toughest climbs.",0230014321,9780230014329,224,Jack Osbourne, , ,3.89,91,8,Macmillan UK,October 1st 2006,Hardcover,English,386-502259.21_Years_Gone.html

3171,Autobiography of an Allergic/Asthmatic Survivor,"In Autobiography of an Allergic/Asthmatic Survivor, the early life of Sara Marie Jones is shared with her readers. Sara Marie's life depicts a journey from sickness to wellness and recognition of ""all of the gray areas in between."" Though some minor events and occasional later in life insight may be juxtaposed simply to fit certain material in suitable places; the story is basically true. As the X-Files television program states, ""The truth is out there."" In this instance, the truth is self-evident within. While Sara Marie does not propose to know about the reality of little ETs, she knows very well that allergies and asthmatic symptoms exist and are not merely figments of her imagination. Not only are symptoms real, but the afflictions maim, disable and kill. Memories and flashbacks of sickness, even setbacks, haunt her as she visits her grandmother on weekends and throughout the story. She moves her life along from elementary school age to junior high and then to her high school years revealing what it was like to deal with her allergies and lung disease which included frightening attacks and often feeling different and alienated. After becoming severely ill due to her ""ironic detrimental"" decision to work as a hairdresser, she reaches rock-bottom and realizes that her entire life needs to change. With her husband, she moves to Denver, Colorado, and continues her exploration and ""passion for learning about how to be well."" Eventually Sara Marie experiences new realms of possibility and wellness. Especially, she is proud of an exhilarating solitary bicycle tour along the Pacific Coast from Cannon Beach, Oregon to her destination, San Francisco, California. In this story and in herlife, Sara Marie truly does break through and break free of many of her once real and feared limitations. As she says, ""I've run my marathon, conquered my own fear and pain."" This book, which reveals, frankly and poignantly, what it's like to live with allergies and asthma, offers hope, promise and the probability that other victims possess the power within to educate themselves, adapt and also transcend from victim to ""survivor."" When this happens, higher levels of well-being and an improved quality of life will be their dream come true, too. Author Biography: Gail Galvan was born in LaPorte, Indiana and grew up in Gary, a section called, ""Glen Park. Writing became a part of her life in her twenties because she felt like learning how to be well symbolized leaving the ""ghetto"" of sickness behind. In sharing her story, she hopes to help others find their safe passage toward a higher level of well-being. Aside from being an allergic/asthmatic individual, foremost, her daily occupational heart-purpose is that of a writer. Her other work consists of nursing and field interview research. Other books by Galvan include: Sneezing Seasons, the ""inside"" story about allergies and immunology, narrated by Henry, a friendly antibody, In Parents We Trust, and Final Say-Adoptive Love (under the pseudonym of Karrol M. Karlin), and Paycheck To Paycheck—Pre And Post Millennium Style and a book of poems entitled, Affinity for Rainbows.

From his humble beginnings as a boy in Tennessee to his death at the infamous Battle of the Alamo, Crockett is one of the most iconic figures in American history.

Due to the increasing pressure of a new, unhealthy baby and the shame of giving birth out of wedlock, Yuet is sent to live with her grandmother. In an attempt to escape the pain of being unloved and unwanted by her family, Yuet begins traveling throughout Europe. Yuet's life improves significantly when she meets a young French man named Jean-Pierre. Despite their communication problems and cultural differences, their relationship blossoms. The couple is soon talking marriage and sharing a flat in Cagnes-Sur-Mer. The turmoil in Yuet's life is compounded further by her future in-laws' constant and malicious intrusions and the insistence that she abort her baby or face deportation. However, the birth of Christel begins to fill the empty void created by Yuet's dreadful childhood and current circumstances and allows the wounds of her adolescence to begin healing. She now has a new focus in life: the joy of motherhood.

3181,Louis Spohr Autobiography,"From the preface: ""Spohr was a man devoted to his art, and although far from wealthy, often sacrificed his time—which to him, as to most of us, was money—in giving gratuitous instruction to young men of ability too poor to pay for lessons; and not unfrequently has he unhesitatingly dismissed some rich, well-paying, but dull scholar to make way for a poor but talented pupil, in hopes of thereby benefitting his art—and this was his sole reward. Another prominent trait in Spohr’s character was his childlike simplicity, combined with never-failing good-nature and an inability to bear malice. Nor did the many unavoidable trials and vexations of a long life ever permanently disturb his good humour or sour his temper; and even gross injustice failed to do more than temporarily ruffle the calm serenity of his soul. Thus he passed through the world, an active and highly useful member of society, beloved and respected by all who knew him, till in process of time he went down to his grave full of years and honour. As is explained in the text, the Autobiography comes to an end with the month of June 1838; but the description of the life and doings of the great master from that date till the time of his death was continued from reliable materials furnished by Mrs. Spohr and other members of the family; so that the whole forms a true account and lively picture of Spohr’s earthly career from his cradle to his grave.""",, ,0,Louis Spohr, , ,3.00,1,1,Project Gutenberg,June 16th 2014,ebook,English,3872-22697424-louis-spohr-autobiography.html

3200,Coming Back to Me: The Autobiography of Marcus Trescothick,"In this true-life sporting memoir of one of the best batsman in the game who stunned the cricket world when he prematurely ended his own England career, Trescothick’s brave and soul-baring account of his mental frailties opens the way to a better understanding of the unique pressures experienced by modern-day professional sportsmen. At 29, Marcus Trescothick was widely regarded as one of the batting greats. With more than 5,000 Test runs to his name and a 2005 Ashes hero, some were predicting this gentle West Country cricket nut might even surpass Graham Gooch's record to become England's highest ever Test run scorer. But the next time Trescothick hit the headlines it was for reasons no one but a handful of close friends and colleagues could have foreseen. On Saturday, February 25, 2006, four days before leading England into the first Test against India in place of the injured captain Vaughan, Trescothick was out for 32 in the second innings of the final warm-up match. As he walked from the field he fought to calm the emotional storm that was raging inside him, at least to hide it from prying eyes. In the dressing room he broke down in tears, overwhelmed by a blur of anguish, uncertainty, and sadness he had been keeping at bay for longer than he knew. Within hours England's best batsman was on the next flight home. His departure was kept secret until after close of play when coach Duncan Fletcher told the stunned media his acting captain had quit the tour for personal, family reasons. Until now, the full, extraordinary story of what happened that day and why, of what preceded his breakdown has never been told. He reveals for the first time that he almost flew home from the 2004 tour to South Africa, what caused it, and what followed—his comeback to the England side and a second crushing breakdown nine months later that left him unable to continue the 2006–2007 Ashes tour down under. Coming Back to Me will replace the myths and rumors with the truth as Trescothick talks with engaging openness and enthusiasm about his rise to the top of international cricket; and describes with equal frankness his tortured descent into private despair.",0007285809,9780007285808,384,Marcus Trescothick, , ,3.98,288,31,HarperCollins UK,September 1st 2008,Hardcover,English,389-5035560-coming-back-to-me.html
3201,An Autobiography of a Self-Exorcist,"An Autobiography of a Self-Exorcist is an amazing journey of self-discovery and raw exposure - a soul redemption for the whole world to watch in its divine revelation. Each word captured my mind, searching for the meaning of each step of Khahliso's Matela oa Sekoli's sacred life-path, moving through the experience with him, but also within myself. This story inspires each one of us to confess our own transgressions, both the self-inflicted and those waged upon others as we engage in the sort of restorative self-analyses expressed so poetically by Matela's own inner discourse. This is a read for one to experience in a place of quiet reflection where he or she can have genuine discussions with the soul without the interference of untruths that many of us convey to our mirrors and our associates on a daily basis. I celebrate his honesty, his exorcism, his renewal and his future; you will travel along his rite of passage from the ""land of metaphors"" to the ""lands of the flute-speakers"" experiencing the inevitable pain of evolution, but ultimately leaving you ""mesmerized by the song of new waters.""

3204,De Quincey's Art Of Autobiography,"Covering all the major themes of Thomas De Quincey's prose work, this new study argues the case for acknowledging ""the Opium Eater"" as a conscious artist, not the ""flawed"" writer often portrayed in previous critical studies. The book analyzes in detail the various manifestations of De Quincey's writings-autobiography, biography, fiction, politics, and political economy-relating them to the central concern of his work, the production of the self. By deconstructing De Quincey's working methods the book shows how De Quincey's constant revisions and recurrent tropes reflect his self-conscious purpose. Reference is made to many neglected writings, including letters, a newly discovered fiction, and previously ""lost"" work, to help illustrate the book's argument that De Quincey's oeuvre is primarily autobiographical. Contents: Acknowledgements; Bibliographical Note and Short Titles List; Introduction; Confessions of an English Opium-Eater; Autobiographical Essays; Biographical Interventions: sketches of Coleridge and Wordsworth; and Sir Hamilton; Fictions; 'The English Mail-Coach' and De Quincey's political works; The Logic of Political EconomyàR and related works; Notes; Bibliography; IndexàR",0748601384,9780748601387,218,Edmund Baxter, , ,0.00,0,0,Edinburgh University Press,January 1st 1990,Unknown Binding,English,3893-4468557-de-quincey-s-art-of-autobiography.html
3205,A Clip of Steel: A Picaresque Autobiography,"A Clip of Steel was first published in 1969, when Thomas Blackburn was fifty-three years old. He had often explored the traumas of his childhood and early life in his poetry, but in this memoir he tells the story in its terrifying entirety. He called the work ‘a picaresque autobiography’ and in a writing style that races you through the pages, he confronts his own and his family's demons with humour, compassion and not a trace of self-pity. By the end of the book he seems to have more or less survived the experience of growing up, while we, his readers, emerge wide-eyed with incredulity, blinking into the ordinary daylight of our lives. This edition includes a new introduction by the author's daughter, Julia Blackburn. ‘The poet Thomas Blackburn faced his inner darkness with a savage courage and wrote exquisite poetry exploring the demons which haunted him. This memoir is painfully honest about those demons, yet it also reveals Thomas Blackburn as a master of prose. A Clip of Steel is one of the great literary memoirs of the 20th century.’ – Bernard Cornwell ‘A fascinating contribution to the genre of father-son memoirs that stretches from Edmund Gosse to Philip Roth: wry, candid, and at times hilarious, even when the subject matter (racial prejudice, sexual repression, alcoholism and mental breakdown) is at its toughest.’ – Blake Morrison, author of And When Did You Last See Your Father? ‘A lot of it is funny and some of it terrifying. Compared with the Reverend Eliel some of those notoriously difficult literary fathers, Samuel Butler's, Edmund Gosse's, Sir George Sitwell, seem angels of light.... Mr Blackburn has put plenty of thought and characterisation into this book.’ – Maurice Richardson, Observer ‘[E]xceedingly intelligent and elegantly structured ... the true poet's eye is there.’ – Spectator ‘A highly entertaining book.’ – New Statesman",1939140935,9781939140937,136,Thomas Blackburn,Julia Blackburn, ,0.00,0,0,Valancourt Books,March 18th 2014,Paperback,English,3894-21488376-a-clip-of-steel.html

From memoirs and biographies of notable military figures to firsthand accounts of famous battles and in-depth discussions of slavery, this collection is a remarkable opportunity for scholars and historians to rediscover the experience and impact of the Civil War. The volumes contained in the collection were all written within 60 years of the end of the war, which means that most authors had living memory of it and were facing the effects of the war while writing. These firsthand accounts allow the modern reader to more fully understand the culture of both the Union and Confederacy, the politics that governed the escalation and end of the war, the personal experience of life during the Civil War, and the most difficult and polarizing question in the history of the United States: slavery. The American Civil War Collection allows new readers access to the contemporary arguments and accounts surrounding the war, and is a vital new tool in understanding this important and pivotal chapter in American history.",1117876683,9781117876689,374,Theophilus Noel, , ,0.00,0,0,BCR (Bibliographical Center for Research),March 11th 2010,Paperback,English,3904-10024689-autobiography-and-reminiscences-of-theophilus-noel.html
3217,"I, Louis. Autobiography of a Dog.","Book One I, Louis is the story in his own words of a portly, elitist English Setter dog who is adopted by a Woman in Oregon and, soon after, taken to Austin, Texas where he observes and reports on the goings-on in and around their home on Annie Street. Louis has a brother, a Gordon Setter named Jones, who is the source of much envy owing to his great beauty and his near-monopoly on the affections of the Woman. Soon after they arrive in Texas, they are joined by the Old Woman, the Woman’s mother; she is an amusing, foul-mouthed, semi-bitter octogenarian who has become infirm and needs to be closer to family. She takes up residence in a little cottage in the Woman’s back yard. Several botched romantic encounters ensue, until the Woman meets Detective Dooley who is investigating the murder of a man the Woman dated. They fall in love, he meets her brother Marc, who is a pot grower in Hawaii, they break up, the Woman acquires a parakeet named Gomez, and Louis falls deeply in love with the bird. Jones misses Dooley and is laid low by despair. Book One ends with fire sweeping through the Annie Street compound; the Old Woman lives, Gomez lives but disappears; Dooley appears and rescues Jones, but is it too late? Book Two We meet Cruz Pardo, ex-con, ex-junkie, male nurse. He has been called upon to care for the Old Woman, whose abilities have waned since the fire, though her wit and attitude remain intact. They spend their days discussing prison, figure skating and collective nouns, among other things. Dooley is now living at the rebuilt compound, in a fancy tree house, his reward for saving the life (yes, he lives!) of the beloved Jones. Louis believes that Gomez is lost and living with a group of wild parrots in a nearby softball field; he is correct. He runs away to find him. Gomez is rescued but both Louis and the Woman are injured in the process. Brother Marc meets Cruz Pardo, who pegs him as a phony. Marc robs a tourist train; Louis gets Horner’s Syndrome; Dooley gets cancer of the esophagus. The family decamps to Houston, Texas to do battle with a dreadful disease. Book Three Louis passes from the earth, but in no way does it affect his reportage. Not long after, Dooley loses his battle with cancer. Now they are together in the hereafter, which turns out to be a pretty nice place. They have plenty of amusements, and plenty of ways to comfort the Woman. She deals with her loss by trying to contact Dooley through a medium, and by getting another dog – Homer, also English. Gomez deals with his loss by sitting atop the brass urn that holds Louis, and gazing out the window. Jones, as Louis might say, isn’t evolved enough to have grief – besides, he and Homer have become good friends. The Old Woman and Cruz Pardo carry on, as odd and devoted a couple as ever there was. After much grief-fueled flailing, The Woman has an aha moment and volunteers to work with hospice patients, thinking it’s as close to Dooley as she can get, for the time being anyway. It is here she meets Dennis, who encourages her to write her story. And so she does – in the voice of her old dog Louis. “And the way our woman tells the story,” says Louis, “well, it never really has to end.” And indeed, it does not.",, ,0,Teresa Elliott, , ,5.00,1,0, , ,Kindle Edition,English,3905-22061292-i-louis-autobiography-of-a-dog.html

3219,Grandma's War: An Autobiography,"The rain of devastation falling from the skies on Pearl Harbor that fateful December 7, 1941, was numbing, then horrifying, with the realization that Japan's attack, along with Europe's war, was now ours. Rising up out of isolation, our fighting men went to battle, and those left behind rallied to work in shipyards, airplane factories, and defense plants, rolling bandages, collecting scrap, buying stamps and bonds, and praying. We lived each day with the anxiety and fears that having a loved one in harm's way brings, and we waited. When the fighting stopped and the boys came marching home, we joined in a concerted effort to bind up the wounds of war and get on with our lives-until Korea-and we were at war again. 1953 saw its ending-except for occupation. WWII was not really over until 1955 when the occupation troops came home, and the waiting was only for the missing in action. The face of war has changed with weaponry, uniforms, and strategies transformed by a skyrocketing technology. One thing has not changed! Waiting for the loved ones in harm's way-it is the same. It will never change. And so we wait with our yellow ribbons.",0595674372,9780595674374,268,H. Jae Benoy, , ,2.00,1,0,iUniverse,November 24th 2005,Hardcover,English,3907-2110318.Grandma_s_War.html

3221,My Autobiography! The Magic Man!,"My Autobiography – About The Book! An Account of a person's life and as written by that person! www.createspace.com/5453424 This is my 30th book – and after 6 books on Arab Management, 3 on Road Safety, 12 on my Columns Writings ‘Between Us Only!’ and ‘At My Workplace!’ and the rest on assorted topics! The columns were running for more than 14 years ‘before being brought down with a big thud!’ mainly based on a Technicality! The book is a bird’s eye view all about me from my all varied articles to date! If one wants to write my Obituary then there is no place to start than from this book – but not forgetting reading the other books as well! I apologise in advance – as I do feel I may have missed out in some articles. But writing my Bibliography, this book will go 90% in doing the work! The articles produced here are in main part linked to me as Majid aka as Magic – Magic Man as the pseudonym I used in ‘The Forums’! Also interestingly the article – Why Do They Call You Magic? Also Who Is Majid? And My Epitaph! The articles are also about My Family and My Late Parents – Peace Be Upon Them! There are several bits and pieces spread out in my other 28 books where they could also come here – but then the book will be very big in size and in contents! I hope you will like reading about me! People were always asking me – Why don’t you write a book about yourself? The story of your life? I then decided to accept the challenge and write this book. Like the other books – I have tried to be as factual as possible – and with my usual style of writing of speaking to you directly from my heart – and to be as sincere, genuine, frank, forthright as possible – so that this book can not only be used in Research works – but as a Guide and Beacon for the children, grandchildren, great grandchildren – and future generations by the Grace of Allah God – Ameen Amen. This is a frank, honest, open and call-a-spade-a-spade no punch-spared, no barrels held stuff and no frills play book – and as my usual style of speaking to you direct from my heart! As if we know each other a long time – and there are no barriers or secrets between us – or as famously Between Us Only! Nobody has been spared here – and that includes even myself too!

3222,Autobiography of a Hunted Priest,"Truth is stranger than fiction. And nowhere in literature is it so apparent as in this classic work, ""The Autobiography of a Hunted Priest."" This autobiography of a Jesuit priest in Elizabethan England is a most remarkable document and John Gerard, its author, a most remarkable priest in a time when to be a Catholic in England courted imprisonment and torture; to be a priest was treason by act of Parliament.Smuggled into England after his ordination and dumped on a Norfolk beach at night, Fr. Gerard disguised himself as a country gentleman and traveled about the country saying Mass, preaching and ministering to the faithful in secret always in constant danger. The houses in which he found shelter were frequently raided by priest hunters; priest-holes, hide-outs and hair-breadth escapes were part of his daily life. He was finally caught and imprisoned, and later removed to the infamous Tower of London where he was brutally tortured. The stirring account of his escape, by means of a rope thrown across the moat, is a daring and magnificent climax to a true story which, for sheer narrative power and interest, far exceeds any fiction. Here is an accurate and compelling picture of England when Catholics were denied their freedom to worship and endured vicious persecution and often martyrdom. But more than the story of a single priest, ""The Autobiography of a Hunted Priest"" epitomizes the constant struggle of all human beings through the ages to maintain their freedom. It is a book of courage and of conviction whose message is most timely for our age.",1586174509,9781586174507,370,John Gerard,Philip Caraman,James V.

3224,The Right Path: The Autobiography Of A Survivor,"Ed Mandel lived through harrowing times. He was a young Jew who was born in Hungary, who loved soccer more than religion. During World War II Ed was forced to serve in a Jewish labor battalion in Eastern Europe and the Ukraine. Near the end of the war, Ed escaped the labor battalion and sought out the partisans. He eventually walked home from the Eastern Front to find that the entire Jewish population of Kecskemet, his home town, had been part of the Final Solution. Ed built a new life during the Soviet rule of Hungary until endangered by his capitalistic success. He left Kecskemet and once again he started a new life in Budapest. In 1956, Ed participated in the Hungarian Revolution. He and his family eventually escaped Hungary in a harrowing night crossing into Austria. From Austria he migrated to the United States and became an American citizen. As Ed would always say, ""Only someone who dreamed to live in America can truly appreciate its greatness."" In America, Ed became a successful businessman and pursued his love of soccer by coaching. He made full circle and eventually brought his American youth team to play Hungarians on Hungarian soil in 1985. Although Ed's stories are filled with an incredible sense of history, that is not why they are transforming. His stories are of ordinary people who turn extraordinary because of events. The best of man and the worst of man are seen in the simplest of relationships: from the men who worked on the railroads and looked with blind eyes through the people transported in the trains like cattle; to the Christian captain who visited the Jewish households to collect more warm clothes for his Jewish workers in the battalion; to the drunken brutality of the guards who enjoyed degrading, tormenting and abusing. Through all of it there is a moral center, the storyteller Ed, who tells the truth without compromise and refuses to make grand generalizations.

This is followed by his return to academic life, the rapid growth of economics as a discipline, and his itinerarnt research and teaching at MIT, Oxford, Kiel, Geneva, Paris, and Rome. Throughout this autobiography, there are anecdotes, particularly of battles with bureaucrats and politicians while working in government (he was for a period under McCarthyism blacklisted from involvement in economic policy making) and of conflicts with fellow scholars, with many of whom he disagreed, but never at the expense of friendship.",1557861099,9781557861092,0,Charles P.

3227,The Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson,"Written in 1821, ""The Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson"" is not as intimate of a look at the life of one of America's founding fathers as we might have hoped for, however it provides some interesting insights into the life of America's third President. Jefferson begins the work thusly, ""At the age of 77, I begin to make some memoranda and state some recollections of dates & facts concerning myself, for my own more ready reference & for the information of my family."" While we gain some quick insight into his parents, his childhood, and the time before the revolution, much of the narrative focuses on his work on the Declaration of Independence and subsequently his political dealings in the newly formed republic. Jefferson was a man of the Enlightenment who, along with the other founding fathers, made a bold endeavor to create a new nation free from the British aristocracy. His lasting impact upon democracy cannot be overstated and ""The Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson"" is a compelling closer look into",, ,115,Thomas Jefferson, , ,3.00,1,0,Digireads.com,December 14th 2009,Kindle Edition,English,3914-25712122-the-autobiography-of-thomas-jefferson.html

3240,Autobiography of an Allergic/Asthmatic Survivor,"In Autobiography of an Allergic/Asthmatic Survivor, the early life of Sara Marie Jones is shared with her readers. Sara Marie's life depicts a journey from sickness to wellness and recognition of ""all of the gray areas in between."" Though some minor events and occasional later in life insight may be juxtaposed simply to fit certain material in suitable places; the story is basically true. As the X-Files television program states, ""The truth is out there."" In this instance, the truth is self-evident within. While Sara Marie does not propose to know about the reality of little ETs, she knows very well that allergies and asthmatic symptoms exist and are not merely figments of her imagination. Not only are symptoms real, but the afflictions maim, disable and kill. Memories and flashbacks of sickness, even setbacks, haunt her as she visits her grandmother on weekends and throughout the story. She moves her life along from elementary school age to junior high and then to her high school years revealing what it was like to deal with her allergies and lung disease which included frightening attacks and often feeling different and alienated. After becoming severely ill due to her ""ironic detrimental"" decision to work as a hairdresser, she reaches rock-bottom and realizes that her entire life needs to change. With her husband, she moves to Denver, Colorado, and continues her exploration and ""passion for learning about how to be well."" Eventually Sara Marie experiences new realms of possibility and wellness. Especially, she is proud of an exhilarating solitary bicycle tour along the Pacific Coast from Cannon Beach, Oregon to her destination, San Francisco, California. In this story and in herlife, Sara Marie truly does break through and break free of many of her once real and feared limitations. As she says, ""I've run my marathon, conquered my own fear and pain."" This book, which reveals, frankly and poignantly, what it's like to live with allergies and asthma, offers hope, promise and the probability that other victims possess the power within to educate themselves, adapt and also transcend from victim to ""survivor."" When this happens, higher levels of well-being and an improved quality of life will be their dream come true, too. Author Biography: Gail Galvan was born in LaPorte, Indiana and grew up in Gary, a section called, ""Glen Park. Writing became a part of her life in her twenties because she felt like learning how to be well symbolized leaving the ""ghetto"" of sickness behind. In sharing her story, she hopes to help others find their safe passage toward a higher level of well-being. Aside from being an allergic/asthmatic individual, foremost, her daily occupational heart-purpose is that of a writer. Her other work consists of nursing and field interview research. Other books by Galvan include: Sneezing Seasons, the ""inside"" story about allergies and immunology, narrated by Henry, a friendly antibody, In Parents We Trust, and Final Say-Adoptive Love (under the pseudonym of Karrol M. Karlin), and Paycheck To Paycheck—Pre And Post Millennium Style and a book of poems entitled, Affinity for Rainbows. She kept her dreams of becoming a published author alive in the midst of a closed world attitude toward unknown writers with the help of Write-On Hoosiers, a local literary club, and the inspiring poets and story-telling writers within the group.",0738865567,9780738865560,114,Gail Galvan, , ,0.00,0,0,Xlibris Corporation,May 1st 2001,Paperback,English,3926-5628950-autobiography-of-an-allergic-asthmatic-survivor.html

From his humble beginnings as a boy in Tennessee to his death at the infamous Battle of the Alamo, Crockett is one of the most iconic figures in American history. His larger-than-life exploits and accomplishments have inspired countless plays, films, songs, books, and folk tales, both in his lifetime and in ours. But how much of what we know about him is true? An Autobiography of Davy Crockett reveals the man behind the myth, using primary sources to tell the story of this dedicated politician, brave frontiersman, and honored soldier in his own words. In this book, Stephen Brennan draws from Crockett’s original letters and writings to craft a rich, firsthand narrative of the icon’s amazing life. Readers will hear stories of his growing up in a log cabin, his days as a scout for Andrew Jackson during the War of 1812, his time as a congressman in his home state, and his explosive fights with Jackson over the Indian Removal Act of 1830.

3250,Louis Spohr Autobiography,"From the preface: ""Spohr was a man devoted to his art, and although far from wealthy, often sacrificed his time—which to him, as to most of us, was money—in giving gratuitous instruction to young men of ability too poor to pay for lessons; and not unfrequently has he unhesitatingly dismissed some rich, well-paying, but dull scholar to make way for a poor but talented pupil, in hopes of thereby benefitting his art—and this was his sole reward. Another prominent trait in Spohr’s character was his childlike simplicity, combined with never-failing good-nature and an inability to bear malice. Nor did the many unavoidable trials and vexations of a long life ever permanently disturb his good humour or sour his temper; and even gross injustice failed to do more than temporarily ruffle the calm serenity of his soul. Thus he passed through the world, an active and highly useful member of society, beloved and respected by all who knew him, till in process of time he went down to his grave full of years and honour. As is explained in the text, the Autobiography comes to an end with the month of June 1838; but the description of the life and doings of the great master from that date till the time of his death was continued from reliable materials furnished by Mrs. Spohr and other members of the family; so that the whole forms a true account and lively picture of Spohr’s earthly career from his cradle to his grave.""",, ,0,Louis Spohr, , ,3.00,1,1,Project Gutenberg,June 16th 2014,ebook,English,3935-22697424-louis-spohr-autobiography.html

3260,Calling The Horses: A Racing Autobiography,"For decades Peter O'Sullevan was one of the iconic sports commentators, providing the sound track for half a century of horseracing as he called home such legends of the sport as Arkle, Nijinsky, Red Rum and Desert Orchid. His rapid-fire commentary seemed to echo the sound of horses' hooves, and it was not long before he became known as 'The Voice of Racing'. But in addition to his legendary status as a TV personality, Peter O'Sullevan was also a notable journalist and much-admired writer, and it is a measure of his standing both within and beyond the world of racing that his compulsively readable autobiography Calling the Horses, first published in 1989 and reprinted eight times, reached the top of the SUNDAY TIMES non-fiction bestseller list. The most recent edition of Calling the Horses was published in 1994, and the twenty years since then have brought many fresh episodes in the ongoing Peter O'Sullevan story, including the last racing days of his great friend Lester Piggott in 1995, his commentary on the 'Bomb Scare' Grand National of 1997, and his retirement from the BBC. He also describes setting up the Sir Peter O'Sullevan Charitable Trust, which has raised over �3.5 million for animal welfare charities, as well as offering his appreciation of a new generation of racing heroes, including jockey AP McCoy, who has come to dominate jump racing in a manner unparalleled in any sport, and the wonder-horse Frankel. The heartening news for the legions of Peter O'Sullevan fans is that, despite his years, his enthusiasm for racing is undiminished, and so are the elegance, fluency and wit which infuse his writing style. This new and extensively updated edition of Calling the Horses is a very remarkable book by a very remarkable man.",, ,496,Peter O'Sullevan, , ,0.00,0,0,Hodder & Stoughton,November 6th 2014,Kindle Edition,English,3944-24062642-calling-the-horses.html
3261,A Game of Two Halves: The Autobiography,"For four decades Archie Macpherson has been one of Britain’s finest football commentators. Instantly recognisable, he’s never been short of an opinion or far from controversy. After joining the BBC full-time in 1969, he established himself not only as one of our foremost commentators but also as a cult figure in our national life. In A Game of Two Halves, Archie Macpherson gives us his unique perspective on his life and career. As well as brilliant anecdotes including his battles with Jock Stein, friendship and a spectacular falling out with Alex Ferguson, interviewing Terry Wogan in LA in a Jacuzzi in an open- top limousine and the Scotland football manager who took delivery of a plain white envelope, Archie Macpherson also tackles tough issues like sectarianism, the sad decline of commercial television and the future of the beautiful game. A Game of Two Halves is a candid, entertaining and thought provoking autobiography which brings Archie Macpherson’s story and his passion for football to life with all his characteristic insight, humour and honesty.",, ,321,Archie Macpherson, , ,3.00,2,0,Black & White Publishing,October 8th 2009,Kindle Edition,English,3945-23798527-a-game-of-two-halves.html
3262,Jona: Autobiography of an Exorcist,"Some Family Trees are Rooted in Evil “Jona is short for Jonathan, a name that I have never been called other than a few times on the first day of school.” Orphanage to Catholic boarding schools then a seminary, where the only father figure in his life teaches, seemed to be his path. Something happens on Jonas’ twenty-fourth birthday: Father Clements gives him a box containing information about his family. The diaries and photos inspire a quest to find out what happened to them. Secrets of prostitution, witchcraft, powerful books and a discovery so unexpected: “You can ask your aunt if you wish to. She lives, if I dare still call it that, in a private hospital run by the church.” “Yes Father. I’ll go there today if you’ll permit it.” I asked, again upright and alert. “No, Jona, not today.” He cautioned me. “First, you must read the diaries and discuss them with me for three months. Then, if you wish to continue, I will call for priests that specialize in these things to counsel you for another three months.” “Priests that specialize in these things?” I was confused. “What kind of priests are you referring to, Father?” “Exorcists.” He said the word then made the sign of the cross. Jona is reunited with his aunt and the demons within her. His teaching Exorcists, a Cardinal and an Army Chaplain, tell him not to believe what is said by the damned. Claims that he is the last of a Roman Emperors bloodline, has abilities not meant for man and is one of the few that Angels watch are becoming harder to dispute. His chosen ministry at the Orphanage where he grew up seems worlds away. Omens are seen, dreams contain messages and demons impatient for Jona to act on their behalf: attack. Discover what the demons want from him and if Jona will finally be ordained.",, ,0,Wllm Worth, , ,3.00,1,0,BookBaby,October 10th 2014,ebook, ,3946-23385075-jona.html

From memoirs and biographies of notable military figures to firsthand accounts of famous battles and in-depth discussions of slavery, this collection is a remarkable opportunity for scholars and historians to rediscover the experience and impact of the Civil War. The volumes contained in the collection were all written within 60 years of the end of the war, which means that most authors had living memory of it and were facing the effects of the war while writing. These firsthand accounts allow the modern reader to more fully understand the culture of both the Union and Confederacy, the politics that governed the escalation and end of the war, the personal experience of life during the Civil War, and the most difficult and polarizing question in the history of the United States: slavery. The American Civil War Collection allows new readers access to the contemporary arguments and accounts surrounding the war, and is a vital new tool in understanding this important and pivotal chapter in American history.",1117876683,9781117876689,374,Theophilus Noel, , ,0.00,0,0,BCR (Bibliographical Center for Research),March 11th 2010,Paperback,English,3967-10024689-autobiography-and-reminiscences-of-theophilus-noel.html
3286,"I, Louis. Autobiography of a Dog.","Book One I, Louis is the story in his own words of a portly, elitist English Setter dog who is adopted by a Woman in Oregon and, soon after, taken to Austin, Texas where he observes and reports on the goings-on in and around their home on Annie Street. Louis has a brother, a Gordon Setter named Jones, who is the source of much envy owing to his great beauty and his near-monopoly on the affections of the Woman. Soon after they arrive in Texas, they are joined by the Old Woman, the Woman’s mother; she is an amusing, foul-mouthed, semi-bitter octogenarian who has become infirm and needs to be closer to family. She takes up residence in a little cottage in the Woman’s back yard. Several botched romantic encounters ensue, until the Woman meets Detective Dooley who is investigating the murder of a man the Woman dated. They fall in love, he meets her brother Marc, who is a pot grower in Hawaii, they break up, the Woman acquires a parakeet named Gomez, and Louis falls deeply in love with the bird. Jones misses Dooley and is laid low by despair. Book One ends with fire sweeping through the Annie Street compound; the Old Woman lives, Gomez lives but disappears; Dooley appears and rescues Jones, but is it too late? Book Two We meet Cruz Pardo, ex-con, ex-junkie, male nurse. He has been called upon to care for the Old Woman, whose abilities have waned since the fire, though her wit and attitude remain intact. They spend their days discussing prison, figure skating and collective nouns, among other things. Dooley is now living at the rebuilt compound, in a fancy tree house, his reward for saving the life (yes, he lives!) of the beloved Jones. Louis believes that Gomez is lost and living with a group of wild parrots in a nearby softball field; he is correct. He runs away to find him. Gomez is rescued but both Louis and the Woman are injured in the process. Brother Marc meets Cruz Pardo, who pegs him as a phony. Marc robs a tourist train; Louis gets Horner’s Syndrome; Dooley gets cancer of the esophagus. The family decamps to Houston, Texas to do battle with a dreadful disease. Book Three Louis passes from the earth, but in no way does it affect his reportage. Not long after, Dooley loses his battle with cancer. Now they are together in the hereafter, which turns out to be a pretty nice place. They have plenty of amusements, and plenty of ways to comfort the Woman. She deals with her loss by trying to contact Dooley through a medium, and by getting another dog – Homer, also English. Gomez deals with his loss by sitting atop the brass urn that holds Louis, and gazing out the window. Jones, as Louis might say, isn’t evolved enough to have grief – besides, he and Homer have become good friends. The Old Woman and Cruz Pardo carry on, as odd and devoted a couple as ever there was. After much grief-fueled flailing, The Woman has an aha moment and volunteers to work with hospice patients, thinking it’s as close to Dooley as she can get, for the time being anyway. It is here she meets Dennis, who encourages her to write her story. And so she does – in the voice of her old dog Louis. “And the way our woman tells the story,” says Louis, “well, it never really has to end.” And indeed, it does not.",, ,0,Teresa Elliott, , ,5.00,1,0, , ,Kindle Edition,English,3968-22061292-i-louis-autobiography-of-a-dog.html

3289,Grandma's War: An Autobiography,"The rain of devastation falling from the skies on Pearl Harbor that fateful December 7, 1941, was numbing, then horrifying, with the realization that Japan's attack, along with Europe's war, was now ours. Rising up out of isolation, our fighting men went to battle, and those left behind rallied to work in shipyards, airplane factories, and defense plants, rolling bandages, collecting scrap, buying stamps and bonds, and praying. We lived each day with the anxiety and fears that having a loved one in harm's way brings, and we waited. When the fighting stopped and the boys came marching home, we joined in a concerted effort to bind up the wounds of war and get on with our lives-until Korea-and we were at war again. 1953 saw its ending-except for occupation. WWII was not really over until 1955 when the occupation troops came home, and the waiting was only for the missing in action. The face of war has changed with weaponry, uniforms, and strategies transformed by a skyrocketing technology. One thing has not changed! Waiting for the loved ones in harm's way-it is the same. It will never change. And so we wait with our yellow ribbons.",0595674372,9780595674374,268,H. Jae Benoy, , ,2.00,1,0,iUniverse,November 24th 2005,Hardcover,English,3970-2110318.Grandma_s_War.html

The columns were running for more than 14 years ‘before being brought down with a big thud!’ mainly based on a Technicality! The book is a bird’s eye view all about me from my all varied articles to date! If one wants to write my Obituary then there is no place to start than from this book – but not forgetting reading the other books as well! I apologise in advance – as I do feel I may have missed out in some articles. But writing my Bibliography, this book will go 90% in doing the work! The articles produced here are in main part linked to me as Majid aka as Magic – Magic Man as the pseudonym I used in ‘The Forums’! Also interestingly the article – Why Do They Call You Magic? Also Who Is Majid? And My Epitaph! The articles are also about My Family and My Late Parents – Peace Be Upon Them! There are several bits and pieces spread out in my other 28 books where they could also come here – but then the book will be very big in size and in contents! I hope you will like reading about me! People were always asking me – Why don’t you write a book about yourself? The story of your life? I then decided to accept the challenge and write this book. Like the other books – I have tried to be as factual as possible – and with my usual style of writing of speaking to you directly from my heart – and to be as sincere, genuine, frank, forthright as possible – so that this book can not only be used in Research works – but as a Guide and Beacon for the children, grandchildren, great grandchildren – and future generations by the Grace of Allah God – Ameen Amen. This is a frank, honest, open and call-a-spade-a-spade no punch-spared, no barrels held stuff and no frills play book – and as my usual style of speaking to you direct from my heart!

Ed built a new life during the Soviet rule of Hungary until endangered by his capitalistic success. He left Kecskemet and once again he started a new life in Budapest. In 1956, Ed participated in the Hungarian Revolution. He and his family eventually escaped Hungary in a harrowing night crossing into Austria. From Austria he migrated to the United States and became an American citizen. As Ed would always say, ""Only someone who dreamed to live in America can truly appreciate its greatness."" In America, Ed became a successful businessman and pursued his love of soccer by coaching. He made full circle and eventually brought his American youth team to play Hungarians on Hungarian soil in 1985. Although Ed's stories are filled with an incredible sense of history, that is not why they are transforming. His stories are of ordinary people who turn extraordinary because of events. The best of man and the worst of man are seen in the simplest of relationships: from the men who worked on the railroads and looked with blind eyes through the people transported in the trains like cattle; to the Christian captain who visited the Jewish households to collect more warm clothes for his Jewish workers in the battalion; to the drunken brutality of the guards who enjoyed degrading, tormenting and abusing. Through all of it there is a moral center, the storyteller Ed, who tells the truth without compromise and refuses to make grand generalizations. This book brings light and honor to all who travelled with him on the Rig",0881254983,9780881254983,389,Edmund Mandel, , ,3.00,1,0,Ktav Publishing House,,Hardcover,English,3974-4792802-the-right-path.html
3294,The Life Of An Economist: An Autobiography,"This is Kindleberger's account of his life as an economist. Beginning with his student days at Penn and Columbia, he traces his career through the inter-war years at ""the Fed"" (the Treasury), and the Bank for International Settlements, onto the war when he assisted in the analysis of the effectiveness of bombing, and then to the post-war settlement in which he worked on the Marshall Plan. This is followed by his return to academic life, the rapid growth of economics as a discipline, and his itinerarnt research and teaching at MIT, Oxford, Kiel, Geneva, Paris, and Rome.

3296,The Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson,"Written in 1821, ""The Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson"" is not as intimate of a look at the life of one of America's founding fathers as we might have hoped for, however it provides some interesting insights into the life of America's third President. Jefferson begins the work thusly, ""At the age of 77, I begin to make some memoranda and state some recollections of dates & facts concerning myself, for my own more ready reference & for the information of my family."" While we gain some quick insight into his parents, his childhood, and the time before the revolution, much of the narrative focuses on his work on the Declaration of Independence and subsequently his political dealings in the newly formed republic. Jefferson was a man of the Enlightenment who, along with the other founding fathers, made a bold endeavor to create a new nation free from the British aristocracy. His lasting impact upon democracy cannot be overstated and ""The Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson"" is a compelling closer look into",, ,115,Thomas Jefferson, , ,3.00,1,0,Digireads.com,December 14th 2009,Kindle Edition,English,3977-25712122-the-autobiography-of-thomas-jefferson.html

3299,A Daughter of Han: The Autobiography of a Chinese Working Woman (Light on China ),"Within the common destiny is the individual destiny. So it is that through the telling of one Chinese peasant woman's life, a vivid vision of Chinese history and culture is illuminated. Over the course of two years, Ida Pruitt—a bicultural social worker, writer, and contributor to Sino-American understanding—visited with Ning Lao T'ai-ta'i, three times a week for breakfast. These meetings, originally intended to elucidate for Pruitt traditional Chinese family customs of which Lao T'ai-t'ai possessed some insight, became the foundation for an enduring friendship. As Lao T'ai-t'ai described the cultural customs of her family, and of the broader community of which they were a part, she invoked episodes from her own personal history to illustrate these customs, until eventually the whole of her life lay open before her new confidante. Pruitt documented this story, casting light not only onto Lao T'ai-t'ai's own biography, but onto the character of life for the common man of China, writ large. The final product is a portrayal of China that is ""vividly and humanly revealed.""",0804706069,9780804706063,264,Ning Lao T'ai-T'ai,Ida Pruitt, ,3.55,237,26,Stanford University Press,June 1st 1945,Paperback,English,398-181422.A_Daughter_of_Han.html

3308,The Secret Springs: An Autobiography,"Just as the mediaeval abbey, a gathering-place of the devout for the worship of God, was also a hostel, a school, a court, a workshop, a farm, and many other things besides, so the theatre, become a gathering-place of the devoted for the understanding of man, might assume a dominant position in the life of a community. -from ""My Theatrical Life"" Few Americans have had as many creative lives as Claude Bragdon who designed theatrical sets and churches, who dabbled in theosophy and the occult, who wrote about it all with spirit, passion, and penetrating insight. Here, in delightfully effervescent prose, Bragdon tells the story of his life-or lives. From his Personal Life (""Born under the constellation Leo, the heart sign, I was never long out of love"") to his Occult Life (""I frightened [my mother] by declaring that I was the chosen vessel for the pouring out of a new revelation upon mankind""), Bragdon is surprisingly frank, frequently hilarious, and always wonderfully self-deprecating. First published in 1938, this is an intimate dispatch from a true American character. Other works by Bragdon available from Cosimo Classics: The Beautiful Necessity, Architecture and Democracy, Episodes from An Unwritten History, and A Primer of Higher Space (The Fourth Dimension). American architect, stage designer, and writer Claude Fayette Bragdon (1866-1946) helped found the Rochester Architectural Club, in the city where he made his greatest mark as a building designer with structures including Rochester Central Station, Rochester Institute of Technology, and the First Universalist Church; he also designed Peterborough Bridge in Ontario. In later life, Bragdon worked on Broadway as scenic designer for 1930s productions of Cyrano de Bergerac and Hamlet, among others.",1596053569,9781596053564,400,Claude Bragdon, , ,0.00,0,0,Cosimo Classics,November 1st 2005,Paperback,English,3988-2471980.The_Secret_Springs.html

3317,Lucky: The Autobiography of a Goldfish,"LUCKY - The Autobiography of a Goldfish is essentially a true story. Embellished only as necessary to facilitate presentation as an autobiography, Lucky's memoir uses vocabulary familiar to Early Readers, yet easily understood by younger children. I first encountered Lucky as Mrs. Wroe gingerly carried the fish toward her classroom in a small, cylindrical aquarium. ""That is the sickest looking fish I've ever seen!,"" I quipped. Candice protectively responded, ""If you'd been through what this fish has been through, you'd look pretty sick too!"" Together, we set up Lucky's new residence and waited for the students to arrive. They were as anxious as I was to hear the story of this latest addition to their pet collection. At morning meeting, Mrs. Wroe recounted the sometimes-terrifying early life of the fish. It is not surprising that the enthralled class decided to name him Lucky. As I listened and observed the student's fascination, it became quite clear that this was a wonderful story for young children, demonstrating both a creature's inborn will to survive and the virtue of human kindness. Somehow, by the end of the day, seated at the computer, I began to imagine how Lucky might like to have his early life remembered. Thus was born his ""autobiography."" As an extra bonus for young readers, Lucky's adopted 2nd grade family thoughtfully drew all pictures; each child assigned a specific page to illustrate. I believe they did a phenomenal job! There is only one illustration where Lucky cannot be seen. See whether you can find it as you read his story.",1438970617,9781438970615,44,Marjorie Frith, , ,0.00,0,0,Authorhouse,June 26th 2009,Paperback,English,3996-7389745-lucky.html

3322,The Autobiography of Ziggy Deer,"Part one of the story of a life, a family and a love affair with words, with life's mysteries and with a certain elusive desire. Ziggy Deer, born with the caul, born among seemingly impossibly attractive siblings, ventures out on the road to self-expression. Her search for meaning and her adventures along the way take her through many of life's ordinary experiences in the roller coaster car of her own imagination. Will she ever be able to compete? Will she lose her fear of being swept away on a wave of emotion like her sisters and end up wearing their faces and their shoes, or will she be able to put on the brakes at dangerous corners and live through it all to wear her own? Set in the suburbs of a South African city Ziggy's tale is one of laughter, hysteria, strange visions and the passion to be a writer. Words visit Ziggy's mind the way bees visit flowers and she has to decide which ones are useful, which are dangerous and which are just plain magical. As she grows from childhood in the early 1950s to adolescence in the sixties and early seventies she learns all about the power of words and visions while she wrestles with the perils of her fascination with a boy from her neighbourhood, tries not to be too intimidated by her ability to see family ghosts and watches her beautiful sisters get themselves tangled up in all the things that make her want to escape. As she struggles to flee the restrictions of Catholicism and social obligation she discovers another world in the feelings and epiphanies that are attached to inheriting the writer's power to experience the world through its manifold characters and situations. She experiences love and loss without being able to detach herself from the past. She finds a final link to the continuity of things in the connections she has made to people that she wants to keep with her as she journeys into the future and she knows that some of these people are living and some are dead and that if she wants to understand them and accept them as fellow travellers, she has to find the courage to acknowledge endings as part of the cycle of beginnings.",146627851X,9781466278516,182,Vanessa Read, , ,0.00,0,0,Createspace,September 1st 2011,Paperback,English,4000-14408127-the-autobiography-of-ziggy-deer.html

3325,Sab and Autobiography,"Eleven years before Uncle Tom's Cabin put a human face on the suffering of slaves and fanned the fires of abolition in North America an aristocratic Cuban woman told an impassioned story of the fatal love of a mulatto slave for his white owner's daughter. So controversial was Sab's theme of miscegenation and its parallel between the powerlessness and enslavement of blacks and the economic and matrimonial subservience of women that the book was not published in Cuba until 1914, seventy-three years after its original 1841 publication in Spain. This is the first English translation of Sab, the best-known work of Gertrudis Gomez de Avellaneda y Arteaga, one of the leading writers in nineteenth-century Spain and Latin America. Also included in this volume is Avellaneda's Autobiography (1839), whose portrait of an intelligent, flamboyant woman struggling against the restrictions of her era amplifies the novel's exploration of the patriarchal oppression of minorities and women. Both works will be of interest to a wide audience, including those interested in Latin American literature and history, race and slavery studies, gender studies, and feminist criticism.",0292704429,9780292704428,185,Gertrudis Gómez de Avellaneda, , ,3.09,44,9,University of Texas Press,January 1st 1993,Paperback,English,403-771680.Sab_and_Autobiography.html
3326,BAD: The Autobiography of James Carr,"""When I was nine years old I burned down my school."" James Carr started fighting when he was very young, and never gave up. A child prodigy of crime in the streets of the L.A. ghettos and scourge of half a dozen boys’ homes, his career in armed robbery was quickly cut short by arrest. In prison he fought harder than ever, and became one of the most notorious rebels in the seething California Penal System. Linking up with George Jackson in Folsom, they led the notorious Wolf Pack, which quickly fought its way to a position of strength in the prison race war. Separated from George, Jimmy transformed himself from an openly rebellious con into a cunning thinker who manipulated the authorities and ultimately engineered his own release. Carr relates the story of his life with a cold passion, powerfully illuminating the horrors of daily life on the streets and in prison—race riots, murders, rape, and corruption—from the standpoint of one who has overcome them. ""I’ve been struggling all my life to get beyond the choice of living on my knees or dying on my feet. It’s time we lived on our feet.""—from the text. ""Jimmy was the baddest motherfucker!""—George Jackson ""It’s dynamite.""— Publishers Weekly While initially having close ties with the Black Panthers (at one point as Huey Newton’s bodyguard), James Carr , influenced by the Situationists, broke with them. Just after this book was completed in 1972, Carr was gunned down in a ""gangland style"" murder.",1902593642,9781902593647,240,James Carr,Isaac Cronin, ,3.96,94,17,AK Press,October 1st 2002,Paperback,English,404-833277.BAD.html

Just thinking of saying “I need” or “I want” left her feeling like an empty shell and that her mind was about to spin out of control. Terrified of who—or what —she was, she lived in constant dread over being found guilty of impersonating a human being. Jeffrey Von Glahn, Ph.D., an experienced therapist with an unshakable belief in the intrinsic healing powers of the human psyche, and Jessica, his courageous client, blaze a trail into this unexplored territory. As if she has, in fact, become an infant again, Jessica remembers in extraordinary detail events from the earliest days of her life—events that had threatened to twist her embryonic humanness from its natural course of development. Her recollections as an adult are the equivalent of listening to an infant who could talk describe every psychologically dramatic moment of its life as it is happening. Jessica’s electrifying journey into her mystifying past brings her ever closer to a final confrontation with the traumatic events that had threatened to strip her of her basic humanness.",0595364292,9780595364299,264,Jeffrey Von Glahn, , ,4.83,6,6,iUniverse,February 9th 2006,Paperback,English,406-9568680-jessica.html

3345,Christine Jorgensen: A Personal Autobiography,"This handsome reprint of Jorgensen's 1967 memoir makes it abundantly clear how moments of grace can descend on even the most ordinary of lives. When ex-G.I. George Jorgensen went to Copenhagen in the early 1950s to consult experts in sexual deviance, he was afraid they'd simply proclaim him a fairy. A full battery of hormonal and psychological tests revealed that, while he was drawn to men, he was no garden-variety homophile; he was a lady. Keeping the secret from his family, Jorgensen endured a groundbreaking series of operations, finally emerging in November 1952 as a delicately beautiful young woman. ""I merely wanted to correct what I considered a misjudgment of Nature,"" wrote Jorgensen, who died in 1989. No one seeing the photographs included here (many of them new to this edition) can doubt the success of Jorgensen's transformation or wonder too long at the fascination she engendered back home, where a newspaper bought her story for $20,000 and she was proclaimed New York City's Woman of the Year. A stage and screen career soon followed. As Susan Stryker points out in a new introduction, Jorgensen offers a somewhat flattering and selectively abridged account of herself in the autobiography, but no more so than any plucky girl smiling her way through what must have been, at times, a harrowing and lonely journey, but one that she conducted with remarkable dignity. --Regina Marler",, ,0,Christine Jorgensen, , ,3.92,61,5,Bantam Books,1967,Mass Market Paperback, ,423-1142263.Christine_Jorgensen.html

Now, brought to you by Kids star Scott Thompson with series writer Paul Bellini, Buddy Babylon takes you on a jaw-dropping tour of Buddy's flashy, trashy life, filled with tales of poignant, heart-wrenching romance, lurid sexual debauchery, the birth of synchronized swimming, and the ugly, never-before-revealed truth behind the Prettiest Feet in Quebec contest. Join Marco (Buddy's cosmetically challenged sidekick), Cornygirl (the loyal corncob doll who rarely leaves his side), and a cast of unforgettably offbeat characters as Buddy blazes a trail across the deep Canadian forest, through the darkest corners of the big city, and back to his signature barstool.

3356,Good-Bye to All That: An Autobiography,"The quintessential memoir of the generation of Englishmen who suffered in WWI is among the bitterest autobiographies ever written. Robert Graves's stripped-to-the-bone prose seethes with contempt for his class, his country, his military superiors & the civilians who mindlessly cheered the carnage from the safety of home. His portrait of the stupidity & petty cruelties endemic in England's elite schools is almost as scathing as his depiction of trench warfare. Nothing could equal his bone-chilling litany of meaningless death, horrific encounters with gruesomely decaying corpses & even more appalling confrontations with the callousness & arrogance of the military command. Yet this scarifying book is consistently enthralling. He's a superb storyteller, & there's clearly something liberating about burning all your bridges at 34 (his age when Good-Bye to All That was published in 1929). He conveys that feeling of exhilaration to his readers in a pell-mell rush of words that remains supremely lucid. Better known as a poet, historical novelist & critic, Graves in this one work seems more like an English Hemingway, paring his prose to the minimum and eschewing all editorializing because it would bring him down to the level of the phrase-& war-mongers he despises.--Wendy Smith",0385093306,9780385093309,347,Robert Graves, , ,4.05,6127,404,Anchor Books,February 1st 1958,Paperback,English,434-477900.Good_Bye_to_All_That.html

Andersen masterfully depicts the extreme poverty of his provincial childhood and the international celebrity of his later years, and also provides insights into the sources of many of his most famous tales.",0815411057,9780815411055,610,Hans Christian Andersen, , ,3.45,31,3,Cooper Square Publishers,September 25th 2000,Paperback,English,440-1364965.The_Fairy_Tale_of_My_Life.html
3363,On Good Land: The Autobiography of an Urban Farm,"In the heart of suburban Santa Barbara, where land is pricey and a field is worth more covered with asphalt than arugula, asparagus, and apple trees, thrives Fairview Gardens, a small organic farm managed for the past 18 years by Michael Ableman. On Good Land, an engrossing read, chronicles the life of the 100-year-old farm -- from its history to Ableman's first glimpse of the land to the current struggle to save it from development. Blending photographs, philosophy, humor, and practical knowledge, Ableman brings the reader into the everyday world of a small farm. With him we prune peach trees, harvest peppers, journey to the farmer's market, and fight city hall. Part memoir, part photojournalistic montage, On Good Land reveals one man's love of the land and his struggle to protect it, and to spread the word about the importance of practicing sustainable agriculture and preserving our farms in an increasingly urban world.",0811819213,9780811819213,144,Michael Ableman,Alice Waters, ,3.91,97,19,Chronicle Books,May 1st 1998,Hardcover,English,441-847980.On_Good_Land.html
3364,Diary of a Lost Girl: The Autobiography of Kola Boof,"Kola Boof's long awaited autobiography ""Diary of a Lost Girl"" is nothing less than magnificent. Many will be spellbound by more than 90 pages detailing her terrifying experience as Osama Bin Laden's former mistress, but the Sudanese-born Novelist/Poet writes even more profoundly about the hardships of being vaginally circumcised, about witnessing her birth parents killed in her presence as a small child, about slavery and Arabism in Sudan, about being adopted and raised in the U.S. by African Americans, about her quest for true love, and in one particularly daring chapter, about her hopes for the future of her sons. Add to that years of psychiatric treatment, a struggle with manic anger and quite a few daring romances other than Bin Laden and you've got the perfect ingredients for a feature film. Critically acclaimed for her powerful novels ""Flesh and the Devil"", ""Pure Nigger Evil"" and the classic short story collection, ""Long Train to the Redeeming Sin""...I'm now convinced that there's no way Kola Boof could ever create a fictional character in one of her novels that is more glamorous, sad, enigmatic and intriguing than she herself is in real life.",0971201986,9780971201989,441,Kola Boof, , ,3.46,101,18,Door of Kush,February 1st 2006,Hardcover,English,442-180026.Diary_of_a_Lost_Girl.html

During the 2011 World Cup he reached 100 caps and has played over 60 Tests as Captain. When the All Blacks beat France in Final, he crowned a ten year career that started with a man-of-the-match performance against Ireland in 2001. Unquestionably the greatest player of his generation, he is arguably the most talented rugby player of all time. In his autobiography, McCaw recounts for the first time, with brutal honesty, the roots of his family life that defined his character – learning to play the game on the family farm in South New Zealand and being inspired to fly gliders by his war-hero grandfather – and how it gave him the strength to emerge from the lowest moment in his career to become the most successful Captain world rugby has ever seen. Unafraid of playing the game right at the edge and putting his body on the line for his team mates, McCaw has set the standard of what a professional rugby player should be.

There she frolicked with the most luminous of the young, rich, and reckless, including Bob Dylan, the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones. Her legendary affair with Mick Jagger produced one hit single, ""Sister Morphine,"" and countless headlines. Faithfull left the relationship a strung-out junkie. Struggling to kick drugs and revive her musical career, she recorded Broken English in 1979, an edgy, hard-hitting, critical triumph.

3376,Hiroshima: The Autobiography of Barefoot Gen (Asian Voices),"This compelling autobiography tells the life story of famed manga artist Nakazawa Keiji. Born in Hiroshima in 1939, Nakazawa was six years old when on August 6, 1945, the United States dropped the atomic bomb. His gritty and stunning account of the horrific aftermath is powerfully told through the eyes of a child who lost most of his family and neighbors. In eminently readable and beautifully translated prose, the narrative continues through the brutally difficult years immediately after the war, his art apprenticeship in Tokyo, his pioneering ""atomic-bomb"" manga, and the creation of Barefoot Gen, the classic graphic novel based on Nakazawa's experiences before, during, and after the bomb. This first English-language translation of Nakazawa's autobiography includes twenty pages of excerpts from Barefoot Gen to give readers who don't know the manga a taste of its power and scope. A recent interview with the author brings his life up to the present. His trenchant hostility to Japanese imperialism, the emperor and the emperor system, and U.S. policy adds important nuance to the debate over Hiroshima. Despite the grimness of his early life, Nakazawa never succumbs to pessimism or defeatism.

3377,Ronan O'Gara: My Autobiography,"Ronan O'Gara is quite simply one of the greatest sportsmen Ireland has ever produced. He is a brilliant kicker both from the hand and at penalty goals, a sublime organizer of play from the out-half position, and a cool head in the pressure-cooker of club and international rugby. The list of the Cork man's achievements goes on and on: he is the leading points scorer in Irish rugby history, and one of the top ten in the world; the leading points scorer in the history of the Heineken Cup; and the first ever points and try scorer at the home of Gaelic sports, Croke Park. In his candid, illuminating autobiography, O'Gara tells the story of those many on-field successes, culminating in the glorious year of 2006 when his tactical prowess and will to win first helped guide Ireland to the Triple Crown in the Six Nations championship, then Munster to a memorable Heineken Cup victory over Biarritz at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. O'Gara kicked a perfect five out of five in the 23-19 win as Munster lifted the coveted trophy for the first time, sparking wild celebrations heard all the way back in Limerick and Cork. Yet as in any sporting career, there have been the setbacks as well, most notably Ireland's disappointing performance in the Rugby World Cup in France last year. O'Gara reveals what really went on in a divided dressing-room as a series of flat performances sent the Irish crashing out, while he personally had to deal with a series of front-page allegations about his private life. O’Gara has never been shy about the fact that he's fond of a drink and a bet, and he confronts his critics head on in this book. This is the unforgettable story of a rugby player at the top of his game, of a life lived to the full, and of a passionate and proud representative of the people of Cork and Ireland.",1848270089,9781848270084,320,Ronan O'Gara,Denis Walsh, ,3.58,97,5,Transworld Publishers,October 6th 2008,Hardcover,English,455-7668083-ronan-o-gara.html
3378,My Life With The Spirits: The Adventures of a Modern Magician: A Magical Autobiography,"My Life with the Spirits is a rare glimpse into the fascinating, sometimes terrifying, sometimes hilarious world of a modern ceremonial magician. Hailed by critics as the most entertaining author in the field and one of the most widely respected members of the magick community, Lon Milo DuQuette gently draws you into the introspective world of the modern magician, tickles you with hilarious observations and self-effacing confessions, then (often in the same paragraph) slams you in the heart with breathtaking profundity. DuQuette's most impressive quality is that in spite of his many accomplishments he doesn't take himself too seriously, which makes what he has to say all the more appealing. He's been through experiences that many Americans can relate to from his ""agonizing years of Sunday School"" and service as an altar boy, to riding the waves of the cultural revolution of the 60s. After sorting through an abundance of spiritual paths, he finally came upon one that resonated with him.

3379,Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers,"In this fascinating autobiography from the foremost genius of twentieth-century physics, Max Planck tells the story of his life, his aims, and his thinking. Published posthumously, the papers in this volume were written for the general reader and make accessible his scientific theories as well as his philosophical ideals, including his thoughts on ethics and morals. Max (Karl Ernst Ludwig) Planck was a German physicist and philosopher known for his quantum theory, for which he won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. Planck was born in Kiel, Germany, in 1858 to an academic family, and he valued education from a young age. He attended the Universities of Munich and Berlin to study physics under the great scientific leaders Kirchhoff and Helmholtz. His early work mainly focused on the study of thermodynamics, and in 1900 he published a paper on his quantum theory that would change the face of modern physics. Planck worked as a professor at Berlin University his entire life, and he also served as the president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Promotion of Science. During World War II, Planck experienced great hardships while he remained in Germany but openly opposed the Nazi regime. One of his two sons was executed during this time for an unsuccessful attempt on Hitler s life, and Planck s home in Berlin was eventually bombed.

In this memoir, Philip Levine celebrates the poets who were his teachers--particularly John Berryman and Yvor Winters, writers whose lives and work, he believes, have been misunderstood and misinterpreted. In the process of writing this account of his childhood and young manhood in Detroit and of his middle and later years in California and Spain, Levine came to realize that he was also engaged in a quest, striving to discover ""how I am."" The resulting work provides a double-edged revelation of the way writers grow. Witty and elegantly rendered in a prose that is as characteristically Levine's as his verse, this is superb--and essential--reading for anyone interested in contemporary poetry and poets. Philip Levine has received many awards for his books of poems, most recently the National Book Award for What Work Is in 1991 and the Pulitzer Prize in Poetry for The Simple Truth in 1995.

She married Herbert Henry Asquith, who would become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1908-1916). During World War I, Asquith's outspokenness led to a public outcry. For example, she visited a German prisoner of war camp and she accused her shell-shocked stepson Herbert of being drunk. The negative public and media response may well have contributed to the political downfall of her husband. After her husband's death, she was left in near penury and, though she made some money as a writer of numerous autobiographies, her financial position caused her constant concern.

But, if he were real, perhaps his obituary would read something like this: Walter Kurtz, illustrator and self-exposing cartoonist, dies of embarrassment at 48. Walter Alan Kurtz, born September 22,1958, in Cleveland, Ohio, to Harvey and Olive Kurtz (an Ellis Island rewrite from Kurtzberg), was pronounced dead at Mt. Sinai Hospital on Monday. He was rushed there following his collapse at the publication party for his coming-of-middle-age novel, Stop Forgetting to Remember. Kurtz was among the wave of cartoonists who helped to redefine the medium of comics and ushered in an explosion of interest in the graphic novel. He was noted for drawing the world-famous “Ebony vs. Ivory” for Nuts magazine every month and for cofounding the political zine Bomb Shelter with his lifelong friend Saul Blockman. As an educator and lecturer, Kurtz has encouraged legions of aspiring cartoonists to avoid entering the field. He was a successful illustrator whose work appeared in numerous newspapers and magazines, but his heart belonged to cartooning until the end. Survived by his wife, Sandra B. Russ, and their only child. Of course, a laundry list of Walter Kurtz’s accomplishments barely scratches the surface of the cartoon character. Are professional details what define an alter ego? “Brilliantly insightful,” “Painfully hilarious,” and “Pow! Blam! Bang! Comics aren’t just for kids anymore!” are words I’ve heard to describe Walter Kurtz’s work.Yet I can’t keep from wondering whether this excessive praise comes from people who are ignorant of the medium’s capacity to address serious subject matter like parenting and masturbation. But jealousy aside, the truth is, I could never bring myself to delve as deep and reveal as many embarrassing details as he has bravely (?) done in this book. The idea of exposing one’s shameful history for all to see is beyond me, and frankly I’m still baffled by what motivates him. One can only imagine the discomfort this must have created for friends and family, most especially for his long-suffering wife, Sandra. My spouse would have killed me! But let me not end these flaps on a down note. I personally believe his self-immolation illuminates our understanding of the human condition and helps comics take another step closer to receiving the recognition they deserve as a serious art form. The best obituary that will ever be written about Walter Kurtz is the graphic novel you hold in your hands. He’s dug his own grave.",0307339505,9780307339508,208,Peter Kuper, , ,3.54,202,35,Crown,July 10th 2007,Hardcover,English,470-1347507.Stop_Forgetting_to_Remember.html

This is second title in the new (and best-selling!) Nabat series that debuted with Jack Black's You Can't Win . It's a window into a wildly under-appreciated dropout culture that gets left out of the stultifying fairytales that pass for history books—a much more rowdy and messily interesting tradition than the guardians of propriety, steeped in those other great American traditions of puritanism and hypocrisy, let on. Hobo jungles, bughouses, whorehouses, Chicago's Main Stem, IWW meeting halls, skid rows and open freight cars—these were the haunts of the free thinking and free loving Bertha Thompson. This vivid autobiography recounts one hell of a rugged woman's hard-living depression-era saga of misadventures with pimps, hopheads, murderers, yeggs, wobblies and anarchists. ""...her narrative is cauliflower-eared by the brutal truth.""— Time ""Thompson's capacity for taking pleasure in her experiences is as striking as the enormous range of her sympathy.""—Luc Santé, New York Review Of Books Dr. Ben Reitman (1880–1942)—hobo, whorehouse physician, anarchist agitator, and tour manager/lover of Emma Goldman, was a mighty interesting character in his own right.

Nabat books is a series dedicated to reprinting forgotten memoirs by various misfits, outsiders, and rebels.

3399,Diana: A Strange Autobiography,"This is the unusual and compelling story of Diana, a tantalizingly beautiful woman who sought love in the strange by-paths of Lesbos. Fearless and outspoken, it dares to reveal that hidden world where perfumed caresses and half-whispered endearments constitute the forbidden fruits in a Garden of Eden where men are never accepted. This is how ""Diana: A Strange Autobiography"" was described when it was published in paperback in 1952. The original 1939 hardcover edition carried with it a Publisher's Note: This is the autobiography of a woman who tried to be normal. In the book, Diana is presented as the unexceptional daughter of an unexceptional plutocratic family. During adolescence, she finds herself drawn with mysterious intensity to a girl friend. The narrative follows Diana's progress through college; a trial marriage that proves she is incapable of heterosexuality; intellectual and sexual education in Europe; and a series of lesbian relationships culminating in a final tormented triangular struggle with two other women for the individual salvation to be found in a happy couple. In her introduction, Julie Abraham argues that Diana is not really an autobiography at all, but a deliberate synthesis of different archetypes of this confessional genre, echoing, as it does, more than a half-dozen novels. Hitting all the high and low points of the lesbian novel, the book, Abraham illustrates, offers a defense of lesbian relationships that was unprecedented in 1939 and radical for decades afterwards.",0814726356,9780814726358,282,Diana Frederics,Julie Abraham, ,3.45,42,8,New York University Press,June 1st 1995,Paperback,English,477-395212.Diana.html

A pioneering drummer who has transcended genres, he did much to popularize world music with his fierce passion for the rhythms of Africa. He is that rare thing, a critically acclaimed musician who has enjoyed global success with not one but several supergroups to his name, including Cream and Blind Faith. Here, Ginger tells his story for the first time and without any self-censorship. It's an often harrowing, but honest journey from his humble beginnings in war-torn south London to his adopted home in South Africa's beautiful Western Cape.

In the 1970s, he came up with a trans-Saharan trucking scheme, was a successful rally driver, built an ill-fated recording studio, and discovered a consuming passion for playing polo.

3409,After Confession: Poetry as Autobiography,"In an age of memoir, the distinction between fiction and nonfiction has become increasingly blurred, sparking controversy among writers and readers alike. But what about the autobiographical impulse in poetry? In this groundbreaking collection, some of our best contemporary poets contemplate the legacy of the confessional poets such as Plath, Sexton, and Lowell. They also tackle such fiery topics as the nature of authorial responsibility in telling the truth, the focus on issues of self in relation to others and to the natural world, the very essence of craft as transformation, and the role female poets have played in breaking the code of silence. Rich in opinion and theory, After Confession offers the first thorough discussion on the lyric ""I""--the boundaries between literal and emotional truth, memory and imagination, person and persona, narcissism and revelation.

At the time, the latter was only available (in any language, as far as is known) in New Directions' Selected Writings of Pasternak, first published in 1949. The 1958 edition was issued with a new introduction by Babette Deutsch under the title of the book's main component, Pasternak's autobiography.

3419,"Autobiography of Mark Twain, Volume 3: The Complete and Authoritative Edition","The surprising final chapter of a great American life. When the first volume of Mark Twain’s uncensored Autobiography was published in 2010, it was hailed as an essential addition to the shelf of his works and a crucial document for our understanding of the great humorist’s life and times. This third and final volume crowns and completes his life’s work. Like its companion volumes, it chronicles Twain's inner and outer life through a series of daily dictations that go wherever his fancy leads. Created from March 1907 to December 1909, these dictations present Mark Twain at the end of his life: receiving an honorary degree from Oxford University; railing against Theodore Roosevelt; founding numerous clubs; incredulous at an exhibition of the Holy Grail; credulous about the authorship of Shakespeare’s plays; relaxing in Bermuda; observing (and investing in) new technologies. The Autobiography ’s “Closing Words” movingly commemorate his daughter Jean, who died on Christmas Eve 1909. Also included in this volume is the previously unpublished “Ashcroft-Lyon Manuscript,” Mark Twain’s caustic indictment of his “putrescent pair” of secretaries and the havoc that erupted in his house during their residency. Fitfully published in fragments at intervals throughout the twentieth century, Autobiography of Mark Twain has now been critically reconstructed and made available as it was intended to be read. Fully annotated by the editors of the Mark Twain Project, the complete Autobiography emerges as a landmark publication in American literature.

3421,Autobiography as Activism,"A study of three Black Power narratives as instruments for radical social change Angela Davis, Assata Shakur (a.k.a. JoAnne Chesimard), and Elaine Brown are the only women activists of the Black Power movement who have published book-length autobiographies. In bearing witness to that era, these militant newsmakers wrote in part to educate and to mobilize their anticipated readers. In this way, Davis's Angela Davis: An Autobiography (1974), Shakur's Assata (1987), and Brown's A Taste of Power: A Black Woman's Story (1992) can all be read as extensions of the writers' political activism during the 1960s. Margo V. Perkins's critical analysis of their books is less a history of the movement (or of women's involvement in it) than an exploration of the politics of storytelling for activists who choose to write their lives. Perkins examines how activists use autobiography to connect their lives to those of other activists across historical periods, to emphasize the link between the personal and the political, and to construct an alternative history that challenges dominant or conventional ways of knowing. The histories constructed by these three women call attention to the experiences of women in revolutionary struggle, particularly to the ways their experiences have differed from men's. The women's stories are told from different perspectives and provide different insights into a movement that has been much studied from the masculine perspective. At times they fill in, complement, challenge, or converse with the stories told by their male counterparts, and in doing so, hint at how the present and future can be made less catastrophic because of women's involvement. The multiple complexities of the Black Power movement become evident in reading these women's narratives against each other as well as against the sometimes strikingly different accounts of their male counterparts. As Davis, Shakur, and Brown recount events in their lives, they dispute mainstream assumptions about race, class, and gender and reveal how the Black Power struggle profoundly shaped their respective identities. Recipient of Mississippi University for Women's Eudora Welty Prize, 1999 Margo V.

3422,Autobiography of an Androgyne,"First printed in 1918, Ralph Werther's Autobiography of an Androgyne charts his emerging self-understanding as a member of the ""third sex"" and documents his explorations of queer underworlds in turn-of-the-century New York City. Werther presents a sensational life narrative that begins with a privileged upper-class birth and a youthful realization of his difference from other boys. He concludes with a decision to undergo castration. Along the way, he recounts intimate stories of adolescent sexual encounters with adult men and women, escapades as a reckless ""fairie"" who trolled Brooklyn and the Bowery in search of working-class Irish and Italian immigrants, and an immersion into the subculture of male ""inverts."" This new edition also includes a critical introduction by Scott Herring that situates the text within the scientific, historical, literary, and social contexts of urban American life in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Tracing how this pioneering autobiography engages with conversations on immigration, gender, economics, metropolitan working-class culture, and the invention of homosexuality across class lines, this edition is ideal for courses on topics ranging from Victorian literature to modern American sexuality.",0813543002,9780813543000,256,Ralph Werther,Scott Herring, ,3.28,18,3,Rutgers University Press,February 22nd 2008,Paperback,English,500-3063427-autobiography-of-an-androgyne.html

3426,That Bird Has My Wings: The Autobiography of an Innocent Man on Death Row,"Jarvis Jay Masters has taken an extraordinary journey of faith. Strangely enough, his moment of enlightenment came behind the bars of San Quentin's death row. In this compelling memoir, inmate and author Jarvis Jay Masters takes us from the arms of his heroin-addicted mother to an abusive foster home, on his escape to the illusory freedom of the streets and through lonely nights spent in bus stations and juvenile homes, and finally to life inside the walls of San Quentin State Prison. Using the nub and filler from a ballpoint pen (the only writing instrument allowed him in solitary confinement), Masters chronicles the story of a bright boy who turns to a life of crime, and of a penitent man who embraces Buddhism to find hope in this ultimately inspirational story. Masters has written his remarkable story as a cautionary tale for anyone who might be tempted to follow in his footsteps, and as a plea for under-standing to a world that too often ignores the plight of the forgotten members of society. His personal story dramatically reminds us all that freedom and opportunity are not to be taken for granted, and that no matter what their neighborhood, no matter what their race, every child matters.",0061730459,9780061730450,304,Jarvis Jay Masters, , ,4.11,198,44,HarperOne,September 22nd 2009,Hardcover,English,504-6341062-that-bird-has-my-wings.html

One of the original Busby Babes; he has devoted his career to the club, playing in 754 games over 17 years, and winning everything the game had to offer. He played alongside some of the greats such as Best and Law, suffered devastating defeats and was involved in one of the greatest soccer tragedies of all time.

Inevitably, such highs are balanced with no less dramatic lows, such as the 1957 European Cup semi-final, the highly charged 1958 FA Cup loss which followed only weeks after the Munich Air disaster, and the 1969 European Cup defeat by Milan.

Although ""Mr. Tanner's"" attentions were directed more toward his other wives, Annie nonetheless bore him eight children. Her attempts to understand this loveless product of her church's bidding are impressive and poignant. Even her wedding was unhappy--conducted in secrecy and not immediately consummated. She spent the night with her parents. After a simple dinner, she thought, ""Well, this is my wedding supper."" Not until three weeks later did her husband arrive to sleep with her, then returned to his first wife. Within six months he was courting another young woman. Twenty-nine years later, according to Annie: ""One Sunday morning as my husband and I stood on the front porch of our home together, he informed me that he would not come to Farmington to see us any more."" Their marriage ended as unceremoniously as it had begun, with another surprise when, ""As he stepped from the porch to the walk, he turned to add: 'You must look to your brothers for help.'"" She would receive no alimony or child support. In the end, even though Annie was a good mother, she was, like so many other plural wives, little more than a mistress to her husband.

3447,Only When I Laugh: My Autobiography,"Known for his intelligent and often surreal humour, Paul Merton’s weekly appearances on BBC1’s Have I Got News For You – as well as Radio 4’s Just A Minute and his travel documentaries – have seen him become an artfully rebellious fixture in our lives for over 25 years. He also has a real story to tell. In ONLY WHEN I LAUGH, his rich and beautifully-observed autobiography, Paul takes us on an evocative journey from his working-class Fulham childhood to the present day. Whether writing about school days, his run-ins with the nuns and other pupils; his disastrous first confession; his meatpacking job; taking acid; leaving home to live in bedsit; his early brushes with the opposite sex – and not forgetting his repeated attempts to break into the world of comedy – Paul’s writing is always funny, poignant and revealing. And when his star finally ascends in the atmospherically drawn 1980s alternative cabaret scene there is a sense of excitement, energy, camaraderie, momentum and dramatic impending success… …And then CRASH! In an unflinching and brilliantly written section that defines the book, we experience the disorienting and terrifying sustained manic episode that he suffered which landed him in a psychiatric hospital. These, and other tougher moments, are written about candidly and with sensitivity and honesty. Yet throughout ONLY WHEN I LAUGH, Paul Merton succeeds in telling his life story entertainingly, with warmth, humour and a big bucket load of wit. Ultimately uplifting, it is the story of a fascinating life, brilliantly told – and one of the best memoirs of the year.",, ,352,Paul Merton, , ,3.75,148,27,Ebury Digital,September 25th 2014,Kindle Edition,English,525-23303307-only-when-i-laugh.html

3453,Zither & Autobiography,"Poetry. ZITHER & AUTOBIOGRAPHY is comprised of two parts: the author's autobiography and a book-length poem entitled ""Zither."" Both parts of the book are concerned with facts and their undoing. In AUTOBIOGRAPHY, Scalapino explores her shifting memories of childhood--especially of years spent in Asia--experimenting with the memoir form to explore how a view of one's own life develops, how ""fixed memories move as illusion.""

The image of man as a cross between Pascal's ""thinking reed"" and Falstaff's ""forked radish,"" that Medawar invokes with the title to his autobiography, stems from his humble desire ""not to claim for myself as an author any distinction more extravagant than membership of the human race.""

Of those 34 years, 17 have been spent putting his body through hell in perhaps the toughest football competition on the planet. Lockyer has, quite literally, spent half his lifetime in the NRL. By season's end Lockyer is set to hold the all–time appearance record for club, state, and country. The remarkable longevity of Lockyer's excellence has earned him the respect of fellow athletes around the world and the adoration of fans everywhere. But while undoubtedly one of the most recognizable athletes in Australia, Lockyer has largely maintained his privacy, rarely, if ever, allowing fans a look at the man behind the man.

But in this volume, Marvin Lowenthal has drawn from his letters, essays, travel writings, and manuscripts to create a biography of his life told in his own words, thereby fulfilling Montaigne s intention of presenting his self-portrait to the world. For it was Montaigne who wrote, My book and I are one, and into his writing he poured the amazing varieties of his perceptions, his unflinching powers of observation and analysis, and his deeply felt love of humanity in all its messy contrariness. Above his desk, on a beam on his ceiling, were inscribed the words nihil humani alieni mihi puto : nothing human is alien to me and nothing was, for into his writing he distilled his tender heart and biting wit, his nonsense and wisdom, his passions and his hates. By collecting and arranging these autobiographical passages into a unified whole, Lowenthal has framed a complete portrait in this rich and rewarding book. All of Montaigne is here: his adventures and love affairs, his marriage, travels, tastes, and opinions.

3488,Beckham: Both Feet on the Ground: An Autobiography,"In England, where he spent ten seasons leading his storied club Manchester United and his nation to soccer glory, he is so wildly popular that his countrymen voted him the face they'd most want to see imprinted on their money. (Winston Churchill finished second.) In Japan, where he is worshiped as much for his headline-making fashion trends as for his ability to bend a ball around a wall of defenders, women styled their bikini waxes after the blond mohawk he sported during the 2002 World Cup. And in Spain, within days of his $41 million trade to Real Madrid, his new team received two million requests to buy his number 23 jersey. The legend of David Beckham -- soccer god, global sex symbol, style icon -- has been celebrated around the world, arguably more than Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan combined. Now, with the publication of his long-awaited autobiography, the man who inspired the surprise hit movie ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is set to conquer the last remaining outpost where soccer is not a national religion: the United States. ""Beckham"" is a classic rags-to-riches saga: a boy, David, is born to a poor East End London family. He develops prodigious soccer skills, and his parents nurture him until he becomes one of the most gifted athletes of his generation. He grows up to marry Victoria -- a Spice Girl, ""Posh"" -- and enters a celebrity whirlwind of Princess Diana -- esque proportions. Together, the Beckhams are Britain's new royal couple -- their 240-acre estate outside of London is known as Beckingham Palace -- and their presence at parties or charity events guarantees endless tabloid stories and photos as well as adoring mobs that must be restrained by police barricades. Their life is as much a study in managing fame as it is in sports and pop phenomena. In ""Beckham"" he talks candidly about the pressures of celebrity -- his wife and sons were the targets of a 2002 kidnapping plot; how he balances his roles as a devoted husband and besotted father with his globetrotting existence as an international soccer player; the behind-the-scenes stories of his most memorable career moments, such as the penalty kick against archrival Argentina in the World Cup that redeemed him to a nation who blamed him for their failure in the previous World Cup; the controversy surrounding his move to Real Madrid and the falling out with the man who shaped his career, Manchester United's famously combative manager Sir Alex Ferguson; and, finally, his love of America -- his first son was conceived in and named Brooklyn -- where, like the great Pele, David can imagine playing out his final seasons. So much has been written about David Beckham that it's easy to think we know everything about the world's most famous athlete, but only Beckham himself can set the record straight on his beliefs, his dreams, his loves, his fears, and, above all, his sense of who he is. ""Beckham ""is an intimate account of an extraordinary life, a life in which, against all odds, he has managed to keep both feet on the ground.",0060727365,9780060727369,464,David Beckham,Tom Watt, ,4.10,63,6,HarperCollins,October 14th 2003,ebook, ,564-17743713-beckham.html

3490,Dreaming to Some Purpose: The Autobiography of Colin Wilson,"Colin Wilson is the bete-noir of the Oxbridge literary establishment. He never went to university, let alone Oxbridge, yet wrote The Outsider , a brilliant account of the pain of being alive today, when he was just twenty-four. It sold millions of copies around the world, and he was acclaimed as one of the leading intellectuals of the age, finding a huge audience with the anti-establishment, alternative and underground thinkers. Because of his radically new attitudes he was - with John Osborne - dubbed an 'angry young man' in the article that originally coined that phrase. In this way a young man from a working class background suddenly found himself moving in the most colourful literary and artistic circles of the day. In his autobiography he tells stories about, among others, Aldous Huxley, Angus Wilson, John Osborne, Kingsley Amis, Kenneth Tynan, Francis Bacon and Norman Mailer - all observed with a true outsider's eye for absurdity. He is regarded by many as a true literary hero - Julian Cope stopped a recent concert to pay tribute to Wilson who as sitting in the audience and Donovan Leitch dedicates his new autobiography to him - but he also has huge mass market appeal. His insightful, brilliant books on the Occult, the Mysteries and Atlantis and the Sphinx were all huge bestsellers netting millions of copies. In this return to the themes of The Outsider , looked at from the point of his own life story, he again proves himself one of the great intellectuals of our age, never ceasing to wrestle with the great questions of life and death, and writing with an erudition and an easy way with ideas that is rare in English literary life.",1844131882,9781844131884,416,Colin Wilson, , ,4.18,90,11,Century,May 26th 2004,Hardcover,English,566-2783860-dreaming-to-some-purpose.html

The narrative style is reminiscent of Russia's Olesha, or perhaps a William Faulkner with talent. One can never be sure if the events being related are real or metaphorical. The machine itself, Epikt, drives this home early on. Just when the reader is about to throw the book down in disgust over characters as ""tigers"" eating ""goats"", Epikt declares, ""You know, don't you, that there aren't *really* tigers, this is just a metaphor that perhaps has gone on too long"" (paraphrase).

3495,The Dance of Reality: A Psychomagical Autobiography,"A glimpse into the mind and life of one of the most creative and enigmatic visionaries of our time, filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky • Retraces the spiritual and mystical path Jodorowsky has followed since childhood, vividly repainting events from the perspective of an unleashed imagination • Explores the development of the author’s psychomagic and metagenealogy practices via his realization that all problems are rooted in the family tree • Includes photos from Jodorowsky’s appearance at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and from the film based on this book, which debuted at Cannes Retracing the spiritual and mystical path he has followed since childhood, Alejandro Jodorowsky re-creates the incredible adventure of his life as an artist, filmmaker, writer, and therapist--all stages on his quest to push back the boundaries of both imagination and reason. Not a traditional autobiography composed of a chronological recounting of memories, The Dance of Reality repaints events from Jodorowsky’s life from the perspective of an unleashed imagination. Like the psychomagic and metagenealogy therapies he created, this autobiography exposes the mythic models and family templates upon which the events of everyday life are founded. It reveals the development of Jodorowsky’s realization that all problems are rooted in the family tree and explains, through vivid examples from his own life, particularly interactions with his father and mother, how the individual’s road to true fulfillment means casting off the phantoms projected by parents on their children. The Dance of Reality is autobiography as an act of healing. Through the retelling of his own life, the author shows we do not start off with our own personalities, they are given to us by one or more members of our family tree. To be born into a family, Jodorowsky says, is to be possessed. To peer back into our past is equivalent to digging into our own souls. If we can dig deep enough, beyond familial projections, we shall find an inner light--a light that can help us through life’s most difficult tests. Offering a glimpse into the mind and life of one of the most creative and enigmatic visionaries of our time, The Dance of Reality is the book upon which Jodorowsky’s critically acclaimed 2013 Cannes Film Festival film of the same name was based.",, ,424,Alejandro Jodorowsky, , ,3.97,31,4,Park Street Press,June 6th 2014,Kindle Edition,English,570-22596809-the-dance-of-reality.html

3498,My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla,"""The progressive development of man is virtually dependent on invention. It is the most important product of his creative brain."" Nikola Tesla, uncelebrated oracle of the electronic age without whom our telephone, radio, automobile ignition, and television would have been unrealized, was born in Croatia in 1856. He studied physics and mathematics at Graz Poly Tech, then philosophy at the University of Prague. He went on to work as an electrical engineer in Budapest, Hungary, then France, and Germany. During this time he invented the alternating induction motor which allowed the possibility of the universal transmission and distribution of electricity. Nikola Tesla came to the United States in 1884 and worked for Thomas Edison, becoming Edison's rival because Edison only believed in the merchandising of inferior DC electric power. However, Tesla was employed as the dynamo designer for the Edison Machine Works while he obtained more than 100 patents and designed 700 inventions. He made a power transmission which was an economic necessity, yet his inventions did not make him a wealthy man. When he died in 1943 in his room at the Hotel New Yorker, his notable research on wireless communication by fax machines, radar, and radio-guided missiles evidenced the validity of his theories. He said, ""I am credited with being one of the hardest workers.""",, ,68,Nikola Tesla, , ,4.02,1661,144, , ,Kindle Edition,English,573-18919935-my-inventions.html

3514,An American Life: The Autobiography,"Ronald Reagan ’s autobiography is a work of major historical importance. Here, in his own words, is the story of his life—public and private—told in a book both frank and compellingly readable. Few presidents have accomplished more, or been so effective in changing the direction of government in ways that are both fundamental and lasting, than Ronald Reagan. Certainly no president has more dramatically raised the American spirit, or done so much to restore national strength and self-confidence. Here, then, is a truly American success story—a great and inspiring one. From modest beginnings as the son of a shoe salesman in Tampico, Illinois, Ronald Reagan achieved first a distinguished career in Hollywood and then, as governor of California and as president of the most powerful nation in the world, a career of public service unique in our history. Ronald Reagan’s account of that rise is told here with all the uncompromising candor, modesty, and wit that made him perhaps the most able communicator ever to occupy the White House, and also with the sense of drama of a gifted natural storyteller. He tells us, with warmth and pride, of his early years and of the elements that made him, in later life, a leader of such stubborn integrity, courage, and clear-minded optimism. Reading the account of this childhood, we understand how his parents, struggling to make ends meet despite family problems and the rigors of the Depression, shaped his belief in the virtues of American life—the need to help others, the desire to get ahead and to get things done, the deep trust in the basic goodness, values, and sense of justice of the American people—virtues that few presidents have expressed more eloquently than Ronald Reagan. With absolute authority and a keen eye for the details and the anecdotes that humanize history, Ronald Reagan takes the reader behind the scenes of his extraordinary career, from his first political experiences as president of the Screen Actors Guild (including his first meeting with a beautiful young actress who was later to become Nancy Reagan) to such high points of his presidency as the November 1985 Geneva meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, during which Reagan invited the Soviet leader outside for a breath of fresh air and then took him off for a walk and a man-to-man chat, without aides, that set the course for arms reduction and charted the end of the Cold War. Here he reveals what went on behind his decision to enter politics and run for the governorship of California, the speech nominating Barry Goldwater that first made Reagan a national political figure, his race for the presidency, his relations with the members of his own cabinet, and his frustrations with Congress. He gives us the details of the great themes and dramatic crises of his eight years in office, from Lebanon to Grenada, from the struggle to achieve arms control to tax reform, from Iran-Contra to the visits abroad that did so much to reestablish the United States in the eyes of the world as a friendly and peaceful power. His narrative is full of insights, from the unseen dangers of Gorbachev’s first visit to the United States to Reagan’s own personal correspondence with major foreign leaders, as well as his innermost feelings about life in the White House, the assassination attempt, his family—and the enduring love between himself and Mrs. Reagan.

3516,Daughter Of Destiny: An Autobiography,"Daughter of Destiny , the autobiography of Benazir Bhutto, is a historical document of uncommon passion and courage, the dramatic story of a brilliant, beautiful woman whose life was, up to her tragic assassination in 2007, inexorably tied to her nation's tumultuous history. Bhutto writes of growing up in a family of legendary wealth and near-mythic status, a family whose rich heritage survives in tales still passed from generation to generation. She describes her journey from this protected world onto the volatile stage of international politics through her education at Radcliffe and Oxford, the sudden coup that plunged her family into a prolonged nightmare of threats and torture, her father's assassination by General Zia ul-Haq in 1979, and her grueling experience as a political prisoner in solitary confinement. With candor and courage, Benazir Bhutto recounts her triumphant political rise from her return to Pakistan from exile in 1986 through the extraordinary events of 1988: the mysterious death of Zia; her party's long struggle to ensure free elections; and finally, the stunning mandate that propelled her overnight into the ranks of the world's most powerful, influential leaders.",0671696033,9780671696030,0,Benazir Bhutto, , ,3.87,1129,128,Touchstone Books,January 1st 2004,Paperback,English,59-1290103.Daughter_Of_Destiny.html

At the age of twenty, Leila Khaled wrote, ""armed struggle is the way of salvation""....Yet this determined young woman did not call on her comrades to exterminate the Israelis or to drive them into the sea. When victory is won, she says, we will establish a democratic state in Palestine with Jews and native Palestinians on equal terms.

3520,My Awesome Place: Autobiography of Cheryl Burke,"A rare authentic glimpse into the electrifying arts scene of New York City’s East Village during the vibrant 1990s, My Awesome Place is the chronicle of a movement through the eyes of one young woman working to cultivate her voice while making peace with her difficult, often abusive, family. An unlikely story for someone whose guidance counselor recommended a career as a toll taker on the New Jersey Turnpike, Burke was determined to escape her circumstances by any means available–physical, intellectual or psychotropic. Her rise to prominence as the spoken word artist known as Cheryl B brought with it a series of desctructive girlfriends and boyfriends and a dependence on drugs and alcohol that would take nearly a decade to shake. In the months following her death, members of Burke’s close-knit writing group, who had met continuously for nine years, worked to compile her drafts, essays and emails into a completed manuscript which was eventually synthesized into its final form by Burke’s close friend, novelist Sarah Schulman. This autobiography tracks her struggle to transcend her working class New Jersey roots and define herself as an artist against the backdrop of an unforgiving city, a series of disastrous girlfriends and boyfriends, and an intense, intimate relationship with drugs and alcohol. By the time Burke got sober in 2001, she had witnessed–and made major contributions to– one of the most remarkable artistic transformations that New York City has ever experienced.",0983242240,9780983242246,208,Cheryl Burke, , ,4.18,51,9,Topside Signature,October 23rd 2012,Hardcover,English,593-16065411-my-awesome-place.html
3521,The Autobiography,"Colin Jackson's stature as one of the most celebrated of British athletes is assured; those who have watched his astonishing performances have marvelled at the sprint hurdler's effortless agility and breathtaking speed. With 25 major championship medals under his belt, there is little doubt that he is the most considerable athlete his particular sport has ever known. Colin Jackson: The Autobiography has arrived at a significant moment, just after the athlete announced his retirement after 20 years of top-level competition. As readers of sports autobiographies know to their cost, such books can be by-rote, self-congratulatory accounts of sporting successes, but this is something different. While Jackson discusses such career bests as his breaking of the World Outdoor 110 metres record in Stuttgart in the 1990s, he is also prepared to talk about the bleak moments, such as his less-than-impressive showing at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics after an injury KO'd his chances. And Jackson's life has much more to it than sport: there are affecting passages here on the unexpected death of his fellow athlete Ross Baillie and his acrimonious break-up with friend and business partner Linford Christie. But it is writing about his sport that Jackson (aided by top sports journalist David Conn) really excels at: he makes it clear the nothing less than total dedication is involved in being a winner, and he is unsparing about the consequences of drugs. There is an unvarnished account, too, of the corruption Jackson has encountered in the sports business over the years. This is one of the most impressive of sports autobiographies written. --Barry Forshaw",0563487380,9780563487388,223,Colin Jackson,David Conn, ,2.92,13,3,BBC Books,August 1st 2003,Hardcover,English,594-1238350.The_Autobiography.html

The difficulty is knowing where to start, and then where to go from there. Carl and David Marshall, a grandfather-grandson team, have created a fine and fun do-it-yourself autobiography. The cover of the journal-sized Book of Myself is intended to resemble handmade paper; the inside pages have the yellowed hue of a keepsake found in a musty attic trunk. The book is not especially pretty. But the questions--one per page, divided into early, middle, and late years, and then again into sections concerning family, friends, education, work and responsibilities, and the world--are good enough that it hardly matters. Among the 201 jumping-off points included here are questions concerning childhood toys, crushes, and forbidden exploits; adult embarrassments, betrayals, and achievements; and how one's views change over the years. --Jane Steinberg New edition published in 2007",0786862505,9780786862504,208,David   Marshall,Carl Marshall, ,3.64,55,3,Hyperion,January 2nd 1997,Hardcover,English,599-1446202.The_Book_of_Myself.html

3530,Beyond Innocence: An Autobiography in Letters The Later Years,"This second volume of Jane Goodall’s autobiography in letters covers the years of her greatest triumphs and her deepest tragedies. During this time she made many of her most important discoveries about chimpanzee behavior — including the dark discovery that like us, they wage war and commit murder. She gave birth to a son, Grub, but her marriage to his father, Hugo van Lawick, came to an end. When some Stanford University students working with her were kidnapped by guerrillas, she was thrust into an international controversy. She fell in love with and married Derek Bryceson. After surviving a plane crash with him, she realized that her life had been entrusted to her for a reason. A visit to an American laboratory where chimps were injected with HIV made that reason clear, and she began to dedicate herself not just to understanding chimpanzees but to saving them. Derek’s death in 1980 was a terrible blow, but afterward she threw herself even more relentlessly into the battle to save our closest relatives and to repair the health of the planet. AFRICA IN MY BLOOD told of a young woman finding her life’s work in the place of her dreams. BEYOND INNOCENCE tells of the events that shattered many of those dreams and changed her from a rather private observer to a public crusader.",0618125205,9780618125203,432,Jane Goodall,Dale Peterson, ,3.80,71,6,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,July 12th 2001,Hardcover,English,602-40148.Beyond_Innocence.html
3531,Rhinestone Cowboy:: An Autobiography,"With extraordinary candor intended to set the record straight, one of music's most popular performers tells of his sojourn amid the decadence and destructive trappings of fame - the bucks, the booze, the cocaine, the women - and of the religious awakening and unconditionally loving marriage that literally saved his life. Glen Campbell's boy-next-door persona belied his hedonistic, near-fatal lifestyle. It all started like a dream - the rise from ruthless poverty as one of twelve children in a small Arkansas town and the against-all struggle for stardom, first as a brilliant studio musician (behind artists such as Sinatra, Elvis, Ray Charles, and Nat King Cole), then as a solo performer who in the sixties and seventies sold some 45 million records (including the timeless classics ""Wichita Lineman, "" ""Gentle on My Mind, "" ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix, "" and, of course, ""Rhinestone Cowboy"") and hosted his own top-rated TV show. Too quickly, though, the dream became a nightmare of mad spending, multiple marriages, and abusive and all-too-public affairs, as well as wildly escalating alcohol and cocaine dependencies that threatened not only his career but his very existence. Now a Christian and in recovery, he has stepped back into the spotlight a whole man at last. With the help of bestselling author Tom Carter, Glen Campbell has given us a book that is both a star-studded show-biz memoir and a spiritual testimony that radiates great faith and emotion. Rhinestone Cowboy is his personal gift of thanks to the millions who have supported him through decades of good times and bad - and to the vast new audience who have grown to know him through his frequent appearances on cable television's 700Club and other Christian TV shows. ""A lot of people are going to be surprised by my story, and I hope that a lot are going to be inspired, "" Campbell declares. ""All I know for sure is that it's time to tell it. And as honestly as I can, that's just what I've gone and done.""",0679419993,9780679419990,253,Glen Campbell,Tom Carter, ,3.60,53,9,Villard,March 22nd 1994,Hardcover,English,603-1468273.Rhinestone_Cowboy.html

A Soldier's Way is the powerful story of a life well lived and well told. At a time when Americans feel disenchanted with their leaders, Powell's passionate views on family, personal responsibility, and, in his own words, 'the greatness of America and the opportunities it offers' inspire hope and present a blueprint for the future.

3560,Bit of a Blur: The Autobiography,"For Alex James, music had always been a door to a more exciting life—a way to travel, meet new people, and, hopefully, pick up girls. But as bass player of Blur—one of the most successful British bands of all time—his journey was more exciting and extreme than he could ever have predicted. Success catapulted him from a slug-infested squat in Camberwell to a world of private jets and world-class restaurants. As ""the second drunkest member of the world’s drunkest band"" Alex James's life was always chaotic, but he retained a boundless enthusiasm and curiosity at odds with his hedonistic lifestyle. From nights in the Groucho with Damien Hirst, to dancing to Sister Sledge with Björk, to being bitten on the nose by the lead singer of Iron Maiden, he offers a fascinating and hilarious insight into the world of celebrity. At its heart, however, this is the picaresque tale of one man’s search to find meaning and happiness in an increasingly surreal world. Pleasingly unrepentant but nonetheless a reformed man, Alex James is the perfect chronicler of his generation—witty, frank and brimming with joie de vivre.

3578,The Autobiography of a Sexually Emancipated Communist Woman,"Prefatory Note This is the first time that the complete autobiography which Alexandra Kollontai wrote in 1926 has been published. The sentences and paragraphs in italics were crossed out in the galleyproofs and left out in her time. Variants were indicated in footnotes which likewise were rejected and crossed out. The reader thus will have an idea of the extent and the intensity of corrections made by the author under the pressure of the gradually sharpening Stalinist control. an excerpt from the opening: The Aims and Worth of My Life Nothing is more difficult than writing an autobiography. What should be emphasized? Just what is of general interest? It is advisable, above all, to write honestly and dispense with any of the conventional introductory protestations of modesty. For if one is called upon to tell about one's life so as to make the events that made it what it became useful to the general public, it can mean only that one must have already wrought something positive in life, accomplished a task that people recognize. [1] Accordingly it is a matter of forgetting that one is writing about oneself, of making an effort to abjure one's ego so as to give an account, as objectively as possible, of one's life in the making and of one's accomplishments. I intend to make this effort but whether it will turn out successfully is something else again. At the same time I must confess that, in a certain sense, this autobiography poses a problem for me. For by looking back while prying, simultaneously, into the future, I will also be presenting to myself the most crucial turning points of my being and accomplishments. In this way I [2a] may succeed in setting into bold relief that which concerns the women's liberation struggle and, further, the social significance which it has.[2] That I ought not to shape my life according to the given model, that I would have to grow beyond myself in order to be able to discern my life's true line of vision was an awareness that was mine already in my youngest years. At the same time I was also aware [3] that in this way I could help my sisters to shape their lives, in accordance not with the given traditions but with their own free choice to the extent, of course, that social and economic circumstances permit. I always believed that the time inevitably must come when woman will be judged by the same moral standards applied to man. For it is not her specific feminine virtue that gives her a place of honor in human society, but the worth of the useful mission accomplished by her, [4a] the worth of her personality as human being, as citizen, [4b] as thinker, as fighter. Footnotes [1] Author's correction: created something which is recognized by society. [2a] perhaps [2] Author's correction: to emphasize that which has an importance for the solution of the social problems of our time, and which also includes the great problem of complete women's liberation. Author's note with respect to 2: delete [3] Author's correction: I had a certain presentiment [4a] for society [4b] as creative worker",0805204865,9780805204865,137,Alexandra Kollontai,Germaine Greer, ,4.00,28,6,Schocken Books,January 1st 1975,Paperback,English,646-3234084-the-autobiography-of-a-sexually-emancipated-communist-woman.html

The son of a diplomat, the grandson and great-grandson of two American presidents, a man of extraordinary gifts and learning in his own right, Henry Adams recounts his life from his birth in 1838 and upbringing as a Boston Brahmin, through the Civil War, the nation's industrial expansion, and its emergence as a world power. In the process, he gives us a brilliant history of a changing country as well as a thoughtful, humane, often tender exploration of himself. From the original publisher, this edition of The Education of Henry Adams , newly introduced by Donald Hall, celebrates and honors this classic work on what it means to be an American.",0618056661,9780618056668,544,Henry Adams,Donald Hall, ,3.71,1998,217,Mariner Books,April 27th 2000,Paperback,English,647-947332.The_Education_of_Henry_Adams.html
3580,Final Truth - Autobiography of a Serial Killer,"On September 6th 1991, the state of South Carolina executed Donald 'Pee Wee' Gaskins in the electric chair. In the year prior to his execution, as he sat in Death Row, he revealed his life story to journalist Wilton Earle. Without remorse, and in graphic detail, he told of the brutality of his childhood and the years in prison and on the streets. He described the escalation pattern of violence that brought him inexorably to the morning when he committed the first in a series of murders of teenage hitchhikers - obsessive random carnage to relieve the rage inside him. He told how this made it easier for him to commit what he called his 'Serious Murders': killing victims he knew, including his family and friends. He held nothing back; recounting each murder in ghastly detail, in his desire to stat the 'final truth' about himself.

3581,Sonata for Jukebox: An Autobiography of My Ears,"Dazzling and original, Sonata for Jukebox is a brilliant foray into how pop music has woven itself into our lives since the dawn of the recording age. Geoffrey O'Brien delves into twentieth-century pop music as we experience it: a phenomenon that is at once public and private, personal yet popular. O'Brien's book is more than a history of pop music, although fragments of that history find their way into its pages. And it reaches far beyond a memoir, although it is an entertaining biography of the author's ears and his family's exceptional affinity, with pop music--his father was a leading New York DJ and his grandfather led a dance band in Philadelphia. Ultimately, it is an exploration of what we as listeners hear, what we think we hear, and how we connect that experience with the rest of our lives. The dizzying array of musical references plays like a sound-track as O'Brien explores how our lives are lived in the presence--and in the memory of the presence--of music.",1582433291,9781582433295,336,Geoffrey O'Brien, , ,3.91,22,6,Counterpoint,April 6th 2005,Paperback,English,649-1338287.Sonata_for_Jukebox.html

3585,Joseph Conrad and the Fiction of Autobiography,"Edward W. Said locates Joseph Conrad's fear of personal disintegration in his constant re-narration of the past. Using the author's personal letters as a guide to understanding his fiction, Said draws an important parallel between Conrad's view of his own life and the manner and form of his stories. The critic also argues that the author, who set his fiction in exotic locations like East Asia and Africa, projects political dimensions in his work that mirror a colonialist preoccupation with ""civilizing"" native peoples. Said then suggests that this dimension should be considered when reading all of Western literature. First published in 1966, Said's critique of the Western self's struggle with modernity signaled the beginnings of his groundbreaking work, Orientalism , and remains a cornerstone of postcolonial studies today.",0674483502,9780674483507,233,Edward W.

3586,J. Hudson Taylor: An Autobiography,"James Hudson Taylor (1832-1905), was a British Protestant Christian missionary to China, and founder of the China Inland Mission. The society that he began was responsible for bringing over 800 missionaries to the country who began 125 schools and directly resulted in 18,000 Christian conversions, as well as the establishment of more than 300 stations of work with more than 500 local helpers in all eighteen provinces. He wrote a book called China's Spiritual Need and Claims in 1865 which was instrumental in generating sympathy for China and volunteers for the mission field, who began to go out in 1862. Taylor was known for his sensitivity to Chinese culture and zeal for evangelism. He adopted wearing native Chinese clothing even though this was rare among missionaries of that time. Under his leadership, the CIM was singularly nondenominational in practice and accepted members from all Protestant groups, including individuals from the working class and single women as well as multinational recruits. Primarily because of the CIM's campaign against the Opium trade, Taylor has been referred to as one of the most significant Europeans to visit China in the 19th Century. In this book, Taylor tells his own story--from his call to the mission field through his early mission experiences--""In Retrospect.""",1611043301,9781611043303,106,James Hudson Taylor, , ,4.25,2162,21,Readaclassic.com,December 10th 2010,Paperback,English,653-12356036-j-hudson-taylor.html
3587,Trials of the Earth: The Autobiography of Mary Hamilton,"This wrenching memoir of love, courage, and survival was waiting to he told. Withheld for almost a lifetime, it is a tragic story of a woman's trial of surviving against brutal odds. Near the end of her life Mary Hamilton (1866-c.1936) was urged to record this astonishing narrative. It is the only known first-hand account by an ordinary woman depicting the extraordinary routines demanded in this time and this place. She reveals the unbelievably arduous role a woman played in the taming of the Delta wilderness, a position marked by unspeakably harsh, bone-breaking toil. On a raw November day in 1932 Helen Dick Davis entered a backwoods cabin in the Delta and encountered Mary Hamilton, a tiny, hunchbacked old woman sitting by the fire and patching a pair of hunting trousers. They became friends. ""She began to talk to me of her life nearly half a century ago in this same Mississippi Delta,"" Davis says, ""which then was a wilderness of untouched timber, canebrakes, a jungle of briars and vines and undergrowth."" Spellbound during her visits to the cabin, Davis would listen for hours. At her request, Mary Hamilton began to record memories on scraps of paper. By the spring of 1933 she had given Davis a manuscript of 150,000 words, ""the true happenings of my life."" Married to a mysterious Englishman, she lived in crude shacks and tents in lumber camps and cooked for crews clearing the primeval Delta forests. While nursing the sick, burying the dead, and making failing attempts to provide a home for her children, she retained a gentle strength that expressed itself in a lyrical vision of nature and in mystical dreams. When Helen Dick Davis appeared to Mary Hamilton in her old age, this long-delayed memoir of pain and grace erupted in a narrative of beauty and compassion and preserved a time and a place never before recorded from such a view. Mary Hamilton's autobiography is published at long last after coming to light from Helen Dick Davis's trunk of mementos.",0878056718,9780878056712,286,Helen D. Davis,Helen D.

3589,"Autobiographies (The Collected Works of W.B. Yeats, Volume 3)","Autobiographies consists of six autobiographical works that William Butler Yeats published together in the mid-1930s to form a single, extraordinary memoir of the first fifty-eight years of his life, from his earliest memories of childhood to winning the Nobel Prize for Literature. This volume provides a vivid series of personal accounts of a wide range of figures, and it describes Yeats's work as poet and playwright, as a founder of Dublin's famed Abbey Theatre, his involvement with Irish nationalism, and his fascination with occultism and visions. This book is most compelling as Yeats's own account of the growth of his poetic imagination. Yeats thought that a poet leads a life of allegory, and that his works are comments upon it. Autobiographies enacts his ruling belief in the connections and coherence between the life that he led and the works that he wrote. It is a vision of personal history as art, and so it is the one truly essential companion to his poems and plays. Edited by William H. O'Donnell and Douglas N.

3594,Unbowed: My Autobiography,"Born in a rural Kenyan village in 1940, Wangari Maathai was already an iconoclast as a child, determined to get an education even though most African girls then were uneducated. In her remarkable and inspiring autobiography, she tells of her studies with Catholic missionaries, earning bachelors and master's degrees in the United States, and becoming the first woman both to earn a PhD and to head a university department in Kenya. She tells of her numerous run-ins with the brutal government of Daniel arap Moi and of the political and personal reasons that compelled her, in 1977, to establish the Green Belt Movement, which spread from Kenya across Africa, and which helps restore indigenous forests while assisting rural women by paying them to plant trees in their villages. Maathai's extraordinary courage and determination helped transform Kenya's government into the democracy in which she now serves as Deputy Minister for the Environment and Natural Resources and as a Member of Parliament. Eventually her achievement was internationally recognized in the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded in recognition of her 'contribution to sustainable development, human rights, and peace'. In Unbowed, we are in the presence of a hugely charismatic yet humble woman whose remarkable story carries with it an inspiring message of hope.

From childhood, Moe s ambition was to perform whether it was plucking a ukulele on the beach, or playing a halfwit on a Mississippi showboat. But he only found success when he joined with Shemp and Larry Fine to play, as the ""New York Times ""put it, three of the frowziest numskulls ever assembled.

3607,The Struggle and the Triumph: An Autobiography,"From the time he founded Solidarity in 1980 to the historic moment in December 1990 when he took the oath of office as the first freely elected president of Poland in half a century, Lech Walesa has had all eyes upon him. He became the symbol of freedom and hope not only for Poland but for all the countries in the former Eastern Bloc. Walesa's dreams for his own beleaguered homeland rejuvenated the entire world's faith in democracy, and inspired a movement that changed the map of Europe and altered the course of history. Here, in his own words, is his unforgettable story. Picking up where his earlier volume of memoirs, The Way of Hope, left off, Walesa continues his account of Poland's inexorable march toward independence by reliving what may have been the darkest moment of all. The murder of Father Popieluszko by government thugs in 1984 was a crime of such callous horror that it froze the attention of the nation and the world. Despite everything they had accomplished up to then, Solidarity and Walesa, like Poland itself, were still mired in the dull nightmare of totalitarianism. Forced underground and dodging the secret police, they struggled to stay alive. Yet Popieluszko's death was not in vain. Under the nurturing guidance of Pope John Paul II and the warming rays of glasnost, Solidarity rose again, until even the Polish government and its apparatchiks could no longer ignore Walesa and his unstoppable movement. ""There is no freedom without Solidarity"" once more echoed off factory walls and resounded from church pulpits.

3608,A Kentish Lad: The Autobiography of Frank Muir,"For more than twenty-five years Frank Muir, in partnership with Denis Norden, produced some of the most sparkling and original comedy ever written for radio and television. On programmes such as My Word! and My Music his distinctive voice became familiar to millions as he displayed an astonishingly well-stocked mind and a genius for ad libbing and outrageous puns. Later, working at the BBC and then at London Weekend Television, he produced some of the best television comedy of the 1960s and 70s. He has written highly successful books for children, and two bestselling anthologies of humour. Frank Muir recalls, in glorious detail, a happy 1920s childhood in the seaside town of Ramsgate, where he was born in his grandmother's pub in Broadstairs, and in London, where he attended an inexpensive but excellent school of a kind no longer to be found. He remembers his very first joke at the age of six, when he knew that his destiny was to make people laugh. He also knew from an early age that he wanted to write, but it took a childhood illness for him to discover that humour and writing could be combined. The death of his father forced him to leave school at the age of fourteen and work in a factory making carbon paper. Then, at the outbreak of the Second World War, he joined the RAF as an air photographer and his memories of the war years, as might be imagined, are engagingly different from the usual kind. It was during those years, with their rich fund of comic material, that he began his career as scriptwriter and performer. At his demob in 1945 he moved naturally to London and the Windmill Theatre, that remarkable breeding ground of talent where new comedians like Jimmy Edwards and Alfred Marks vied with nude girls for the attention of the audience. In story after story he recalls the lost world of London in the 1940s and early 50s, when the laughter and creative ideas seemed to explode out of post-war shabbiness and austerity. Then came the BBC, the legendary partnership with Denis Norden, and half a century of fulfilling the boyhood ambition of that Kentish lad. 'All I ever wanted to do was to write and amuse people.'",0552141372,9780552141376,427,Frank  Muir, , ,3.53,58,10,Corgi,1998,Paperback,English,673-1312766.A_Kentish_Lad.html
3609,The Life of Shabkar: Autobiography of a Tibetan Yogin,"The Life of Shabkar has long been recognized by Tibetans as one of the masterworks of their religious heritage. Shabkar Tsogdruk Rangdrol devoted himself to many years of meditation in solitary retreat after his inspired youth and early training in the province of Amdo under the guidance of several extraordinary Buddhist masters. With determination and courage, he mastered the highest and most esoteric practices of the Tibetan tradition of the Great Perfection.

3611,Running My Life: The Autobiography,"One second in time may separate the great athlete from the merely good. Seb Coe has made every second count. From an early age he has been driven to be the best at everything he does. Since the moment Coe stood alongside a ""scrubby"" municipal running track in Sheffield, he knew that sport could change his life. Breaking an incredible twelve world records, and three of them in just forty-one days, Seb became the only athlete to take gold at 1500 metres in two successive Olympic Games—at Moscow in 1980, and at Los Angeles in 1984. The same passion galvanized Coe in 2005, when he led Britain's bid to bring the Olympic and Paralympic Games to London. He knew that if the UK won, it would regenerate an East London landscape and change the lives of thousands of young people. Born in Hammersmith and coached by his engineer father, Coe went from a secondary modern school and Loughborough University to become the fastest middle-distance runner of his generation. His rivalry with Steve Ovett gripped a nation and made Britain feel successful at a time of widespread social discontent. From sport Coe transferred his ideals to politics, serving in John Major's Conservative government from 1992 to 1997 and developing ""sharp elbows"" to become chief of staff to William Hague, leader of the Party from 1997 to 2001, and finally a member of the House of Lords. Running My Life is in turns exhilarating, inspiring, amusing, and extremely moving. Everyone knows where Sebastian Coe ended up. Few people realize how he got there. This is his personal journey.",1444732528,9781444732528,496,Sebastian Coe, , ,4.00,33,8,Hodder & Stoughton,November 1st 2012,Hardcover,English,676-16702398-running-my-life.html

3614,"The Crippled Tree (China : Autobiography, History, Book 1)","In The Crippled Tree Han Suyin evokes, through the life of her two families (eastern and western), a panorama of the history of China from 1885 to 1928. It contains eye-witness accounts, from family papers, of the Sino-French War, of the revolution of 1911 and of the emergence of Chiang Kai-shek. This book is more compelling than history and more profound than biography: it describes how events mould the lives of individuals, and how their private emotions are twisted by the gigantic conflicts of a changing world. The theme of the book is the story of the Chinese family of Han Suyin, a family deeply feudal, rooted in a far inland province of China adjacent to Tibet; yet, because of the western invasion of China, brought face to face with compelling change. Han Suyin's father, marked for a life of classical scholasticism, became instead an engineer, sent by his government to study railway construction in Belgium. There he fell in love with the daughter of a respectable Belgian family, and both defied all the conventions of their societies to marry. Returning to a China in revolution in 1913, they endured and suffered, helpless in the face of tragedy beyond their grasp. Eight children were born to them, while Han Suyin's father worked on the railways of China, and her mother endured the hardships and isolation of an outcast, ostracized by her own people. Nearly fifty years later one of their children, Han Suyin, was to spend years of painstaking research, both in China and in Europe, reconstructing the life and times of her parents and grandparents. This is one of the most important books about China yet written; while other volumes will continue the story, The Crippled Tree is complete in itself, with its own satisfying ending. It is a unique contribution to our knowledge and understanding of the One World in which we all live, east or west.",0586038361,9780586038369,0,Han Suyin, , ,4.10,69,11,Triad Books,August 1st 1972,Paperback,English,679-793712.The_Crippled_Tree.html
3615,The Autobiography and Other Writings,"""Writing has been of Great Use to me in the Course of my Life,"" Benjamin Franklin said in his famous Autobiography. With characteristically calculated understatement, he attributed his enormous and varied successes to ""my having learnt a little to scribble."" This collection of Franklin's works begins with letters sent from London (1757-1775) describing the events and diplomacy preceding the Revolutionary War. The volume also contains political satires, bagatelles, pamphlets, and letters written in Paris (1776-1785), where he represented the revolutionary United States at the court of Louis XVI, as well as his speeches given in the Constitutional Convention and other works written in Philadelphia (1785-1790), including his last published article, a searing satire against slavery. Also included are the delightfully shrewd prefaces to Poor Richard's Almanack (1733-1758) and their worldly, pungent maxims that have entered our American culture. Finally, the classic Autobiography, Franklin's last word on his greatest literary creation-his own invented personality-is presented here in a new edition, completely faithful to Franklin's manuscript. A companion volume includes the complete ""Silence Dogood"" series, ""Busy-Body"" essays, and a generous selection of his early writings, including letters to the press, satires, and pamphlets.",0140390529,9780140390520,304,Benjamin Franklin,Kenneth A.

Few musicians have had a career of such variety: in the past quarter century he has sold more than 20 million albums and been on a veritable rollercoaster ride through the rock'n'roll business. From No. 1 hits with the pop band Slik, via one of the most influential bands to come out of the age of electronica, Ultravox - leaders of the New Romantic movement - to solo success touring the world and selling out leading venues, Midge has a unique perspective on the world of pop music.

3620,An Accidental Autobiography: The Selected Letters,"Fabulous letters from the vagabond Beat poet to his friends -- among them Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. For all his charm and intelligence poet Gregory Corso lived a vagabond life. He never held down a regular job. He rarely stayed very long under the same roof. He spent long stretches -- some as long as four or five years -- abroad. Many of his letters came from Europe -- France, England, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Greece -- as he kept in touch with his circle of friends -- among them his best friend Allen Ginsberg and a steady supporter, Lawrence Ferlinghetti. He left (or was left by) a number of girlfriends and he fathered five children along the way. He was apt to raise a bit of a ruckus at poetry readings and other public events. No one could be sure what he might do next except that he would write poetry and get it published and that it would be widely read. When the idea of a book of selected letters was first proposed, Gregory had some reservations about it. Would the book reveal too much of his private life? But then with typical hubris he said the equivalent of ""let it all hang out"" and ""all"" does hang out in An Accidental Autobiography. The book is indeed the next thing to an unplanned self-portrait and gives a lively sense of the life Gregory Corso led, marching to his own drummer and leaving in his wake such marvelous books of Beat poetry as The Happy Birthday of Death, Elegiac Feelings American, Long Live Man, and Herald of the Autochthonic Spirit.",0811215350,9780811215350,444,Gregory Corso,Bill Morgan,Patti Smith,4.19,26,4,New Directions,April 17th 2003,Paperback,English,684-303534.An_Accidental_Autobiography.html

Bill Bruford once called ""the godfather of progressive-rock drumming"" has been at the top of his profession for four decades, playing with Yes, King Crimson, Genesis, Earthworks, and many more. The Autobiography is his memoir of life at the heart of prog rock, art rock, and modern jazz. It is an honest, entertaining, well-written account of life on the road and in the studio rubbing shoulders with the famous, the less famous, and the infamous, and creating an impressive tally of great music. A rock musician with the temperament of a classical musician who became a jazz musician, Bruford defies all the cliches about drummers. He says: ""You write what you have to write, you play what you have to play, because you can't sleep at night. If you can sleep at night, you shouldn't be doing this anyway."" From time to time, at polite dinner parties, someone will ask Bill what he does. He replies that he is a musician. ""Yes, but what do you really do?"" retorts the enquirer.

This edition sets that book alongside other highly interesting and varied contemporary spiritual autobiographies, making its cultural milieu more meaningful to the modern reader. The search for proof of God's favor, in all its personal and psychological intensity, is offered not only from John Bunyan's perspective, but likewise from those of Richard Norwood, John Crook, Lawrence Clarkson, and Agnes Beaumont.

But it has changed least in the House of Commons. I want to describe those changes and the resistances to them through the magnifying glass of my own life, a life that coincides with our turbulent post-war history. Shirley Williams was born to politics. As well as being influenced by her mother, Vera Brittian, her father George Caitlin, a leading political scientist, encouraged his daughter to have high ambitions for herself—including daring to climb the bookshelves in his library.

These powerful and passionate selections of spiritual autobiography do not merely represent a vital literary tradition; they bring together fifty-eight writers whose search for truth and understanding has spanned over two millennia and several continents. From Saint Augustine and Rabi'a to T. S. Eliot and Kathleen Norris, each of these autobiographers tells the story of the inner life as a spiritual quest. Although separated culturally, historically, and linguistically, they are united by their efforts to respond to Socrates' challenge to ""know thyself."" In four parts this insightful collection includes works by: * Wanderers and seekers, like Leo Tolstoy and Thomas Merton, who feverishly explore many experiences and world views * Pilgrims and missionaries, like Anne Bradstreet and David Livingstone, who unwaveringly pursue God and holiness in lives of self-sacrifice * Mystics and visionaries, like Julian of Norwich and Annie Dillard, who discover the ecstasy of epiphany in a life of contemplation and seclusion * Scholars and philosophers, like Simone Weil and Blaise Pascal, who seek to ground spiritual conviction in a rational certitude.

With wit, honesty, and humility, Blofeld portrays his search for wisdom and his discovery of a genuine spiritual path. He describes in vivid detail his life in Peking and his travels in Tibet, Mongolia, China, India, and Burma: the worlds of remote mountain monasteries, the sacred inner chambers of sages and yogis, and the inspired lives of simple, ordinary people. The book is particularly valuable for its sensitive picture of a world that no longer exists. As Huston Smith remarks in his Foreword, ""Blofeld encountered Chinese Buddhism and Taosim at a very special moment in history, the final moment before they came under Communist onslaught. To have his intimate glimpses into what they were like as still-living traditions is historically important.""

In 2002, he beat Sir Gordon Richards' record of 269 winners in a season by riding 289. In April 2010 AP achieved his lifelong ambition when he won the Grand National at Aintree on Don't Push It.

This powerfully honest autobiography looks at life at the very top in National Hunt racing. These are the memoirs of a true champion, an icon of sport, whose astonishing achievements over the past 15 years are unlikely to be surpassed.

3632,Five Autobiographies and a Fiction,"Five Autobiographies and a Fiction, the long-awaited new collection from master storyteller Lucius Shepard, is a significant publishing event, a volume equal in every way to such earlier Shepard classics as The Jaguar Hunter and The Dragon Griaule. Its six long stories offer narrative pleasures as diverse and profound as anything to be found in modern imaginative fiction. “Ditch Witch,” set in rural Oregon, concerns a young man on the run in a stolen car, a hitchhiker who may or may not have witch-like powers, and the bizarre inhabitants of the seemingly innocuous Elfland Motel. “The Flock” is a tale of high school football and small town malaise set against an impossible intrusion from the natural world. A washed-up actor and a Malaysian “woman of power” stand at the center of “Vacancy,” the account of a man forced to confront the very real demons of his past. “Dog-eared Paperback of My Life” follows a writer (Thomas Cradle) on his erotically charged journey down the Mekong River, a journey enveloped in a maze of multiple, interpenetrating realities. “Halloween Town” tells the story of a small, extremely strange town and one of its denizens, Clyde Ormoloo, a man who sees too deeply into the “terrible incoherence” of human affairs. The final story, “Rose Street Attractors,” takes us into 19th century London and the heart of the steampunk era—in the richly atmospheric tale of a most unusual haunting. Rounding out this generous volume is an Introdution in which Shepard offers a startlingly frank assessment of his own troubled adolescence, identifying the “alternate versions” of himself that appear in these pages and illuminating those points at which fiction and “near-autobiography” converge. Lyrical, brutal, and always powerfully composed, Five Autobiographies and a Fiction is something special. Each of these six novellas speaks in its own distinctive voice. Each one takes us into the heart of a thoroughly imagined world. Only Lucius Shepard could have created those worlds. Only Lucius Shepard could have given us this book.

3634,The Wind Spirit: An Autobiography,"Michel Tournier, one of France's most acclaimed contemporary men of letters, received teh Prix Goncourt for his novel The Ogre and the Grand Prix du Roman from the Academie Francaise for his novel Friday. As a fabulist, his stature equals that of Gunter Grass, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Italo Calvino, Milan Kundera, and John Barth. As an iconoclast in contemporary cultural criticism, he has been likened to Roland Barthes. The Wind Spirit is a literary/intellectual autobiography of extraorinary grace and intelligence, and yet the play of the author's ideas - and of his wicked wit - gives the book a depth and resonane that transcend the boudaries of the genre. Although the six essays that make up the book are ostensibly structured around the author's childhood, education, and the creation of his major works of fiction, they branch out to gice us fascinating glimpses of life in Frnace before and during World War II, of the frenetic bustle of postwar Europe, and of famous personalities such as Jean-Paul Sartre. Equally compelling are Tournier's fresh and controversial views on the topics of sexuality, education, and the uneasy relationship between French and German thought. For those unfamiliar with Tournier, The Wind Spirit provides and ideal introduction to one of Europe's foremost literary figures and to a brilliant body of work. Those who know and admire the author's novels will find here both a source of keen pleasure and an indispensable account of Tournier's creative development.",0807070408,9780807070406,259,Michel Tournier,Arthur Goldhammer, ,3.86,21,2,Beacon Press (MA),January 1st 1988,Hardcover,English,697-3142148-the-wind-spirit.html

Although Swann candidly concedes he was nowhere near good enough for the top level at that stage in his career, his jettisoning back to county cricket for the next seven years, following a solitary one-day international, hinted at a career wasted. A clash with then Northamptonshire coach Kepler Wessels triggered his move to Nottinghamshire in 2005. A County Championship winner in his debut season, he was back in the England fold at the end of his third. Forever a flamboyant showman, he made up for lost time with two wickets in his first over against Indiahis habit of striking in his opening over a spell has become a party piece. You cannot keep the spotlight off him for long. Since moving into the top ten of the world rankings for bowlers on the back of eight wickets in the Ashes-defining Oval Test of 2009, he has not dropped outside it, and has been widely tipped to be the decisive factor in the defense of the urn in Australia.",1444727389,9781444727388,352,Graeme Swann, , ,3.48,40,3,Hodder & Stoughton,January 1st 2012,Paperback,English,698-11551531-the-breaks-are-off.html
3636,Ordeal: An Autobiography,"Good Girl. Obedient Wife. Porn Slave. Deep Throat Was Only The Beginning Linda Boreman was just twenty-one when she met Chuck Traynor, the man who would change her life. Less than two years later, the girl who wouldn't let her high school dates get past first base was catapulted to fame she could never have imagined in her wildest dreamsor worst nightmares. Linda Boreman of Yonkers, New York, had become Linda Lovelace, international adult film superstar. The unprecedented success of Deep Throat made porn popular with the mainstream and made Lovelace a household name. But nobody, from the A-list celebrities who touted the movie to the audiences that lined up to see it, knew the truth about what went on behind the scenes. Enslaved by the man who would eventually force her into marriage so that he could control her completely, Linda was beaten savagely with regularity, hypnotized, and raped. She was threatened with disfigurement and death. She was terrorized into prostitution at gun and knifepoint. She was forced to perform unspeakable perversions on film. She made Deep Throat under unimaginable duress. Years later, Linda would come out of hiding to relate her side of the storya modern horror tale of humiliation, betrayal, and violence that would rock the porn industry and put its teller in fear for her life... Ordeal Linda Lovelace became a household name in 1972, when Deep Throat became the first pornographic movie ever to cross over into the mainstream. Due to the success of Deep Throat, she appeared in Playboy, Bachelor, and even Esquire between 1973 and 1974. Soon after, Lovelace joined in with anti-pornography feminists led by Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon, and she testified before Attorney General Meese's Commission on Pornography in 1986. She died in Denver on April 22, 2002, due to severe injuries in a car accident.",0491029039,9780491029032,206,Linda Lovelace,Mike McGrady, ,3.59,1140,155,W.H.

In her late 20s, Sharon finally made the painful decision to break with her family. Always irrepressible, Sharon flourished, creating a loving family of her own while becoming a legendary manager and rockband promoter. In rock star Ozzy Osbourne, Sharon found her soul mate, yet Ozzy's drug and drink-fuelled excesses which culminated in his attempt to strangle her made their marriage a white knuckle ride from the start; only her devotion to their three children gave her the will to survive. From the tremendous highs of the hit show The Osbournes to the lows of Ozzy's near-fatal quad-bike accident and her own bout with colon cancer, Sharon's tenacity, honesty, and humour have triumphed again and again.",0821280147,9780821280140,365,Sharon Osbourne,Penelope Dening, ,3.84,2150,157,Springboard Press,October 11th 2006,Hardcover,English,70-119822.Sharon_Osbourne_Extreme.html

Now, celebrity ghostwriter Michael Malice pulls back the curtain to expose the life story of the ""Incarnation of Love and Morality."" Taken directly from books spirited out of Pyongyang, DEAR READER is a carefully reconstructed first-person account of the man behind the mythology. From his miraculous rainbow-filled birth during the fiery conflict of World War II, Kim Jong Il watched as his beloved Korea finally earned its freedom from the cursed Japanese. Mere years later, the wicked US imperialists took their chance at conquering the liberated nation—with devastating results. But that's only the beginning of the Dear Leader’s story. In DEAR READER , Kim Jong Il explains: How he can shrink time Why he despises the Mona Lisa How he recreated the arts in Korea Why the Juche idea is the greatest concept ever discovered by man How he handled the crippling famine Why Kim Jong Un was chosen as successor over his elder brothers.

3641,"Sammy: The Autobiography of Sammy Davis, Jr.","Sammy Davis, Jr. (1925-90) rose from childhood stardom on the vaudeville stage to become one of the most famous African American entertainers of the 1950s and '60s (and the only black member of Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack). At the same time, he spent most of his career surrounded by controversy and ridicule--over his affairs with white film stars, his 1960 marriage to Swedish actress May Britt, his conversion to Judaism, his closeness to the Kennedys (and later Richard Nixon), and his problems with alcohol and drugs.When Davis published his first memoir, ""Yes, I Can,"" in 1965, it was a critical and popular success--acclaimed for a candor and thoughtfulness rare in celebrity autobiographies and for its painful evocation of life as a black peformer in segregated America. Davis's 1980 memoir, ""Why Me?,"" laid bare Davis's troubled relationship to the Kennedys, his ambivalence toward the Black Pride movement, the end of his marriage to Britt (and his complex open marriage with Altovise Davis), and his flamboyant, self-loathing misbehavior, from ruinous extravagance to flirtations with Satanism.Davis's co-writer Burt Boyar has revised Davis's memoirs, incorporating material from unpublished interviews, and has added a new introduction and epilogue.

3643,Seve: The Autobiography,"Now the subject of a major film. Once or twice a generation, an athlete transcends his sport - at last, here's Seve Ballesteros in his own words There are golfers, and there are golfers. And then there's Seve. Severiano Ballesteros was perhaps the most naturally gifted golfer ever to have walked a fairway. From the moment his brother Manuel gave him his first club he was unstoppable. A few weeks before his seventeenth birthday he turned pro. Five years later he won the Open. A genius had arrived. For the best part of two decades Seve dominated the golfing landscape. He played shots others could only dream of. With 94 wins as a professional (including 5 majors) he was a phenomenon, an athlete who transcended his sport. But Seve stood for more than simple excellence. Almost single-handedly, Seve gave European golf credibility; almost single-handedly, he made the Ryder Cup one of the greatest contests in world sport. And when, as captain, he finally lifted the trophy on home soil in 1997, a whole continent rejoiced. His pride and passion have inspired millions, and we have taken him to our hearts. Here, for the first time, Seve tells his own story. From his humble beginnings right up to the present day, here at last is the man behind the magic in his own words. Seve is utterly entertaining, blazingly charismatic and unique. Severiano ""Seve"" Ballesteros Sota was a Spanish professional golfer and a leading sports figure. He won more than 90 international tournaments in an illustrious career. He first caught the attention of the sporting world in 1976, when at the age of 19 he finished second at The Open. He played a leading role in the re-emergence of European golf, helping the European Ryder Cup team to five wins both as a player and captain. He won the World Match Play Championship a record-tying five times. He is generally regarded as the greatest Continental European golfer of all time and won a record 50 times on the European Tour.

3645,Triggs: The Autobiography of Roy Keane's Dog,"Meet Triggs - TV lover, hypochondriac, noted wit, football genius and best friend to the most talked-about footballer of his generation. Whether leading Manchester United to the Treble or telling Mick McCarthy to shove the World Cup up his bollocks, Roy was seldom out of the news. For more than ten years, through good times and bad, he could always rely on his friendship with his ever faithful Labrador retriever, Triggs. Their walks became the stuff of rolling news legend. But what did they talk about on all those famous days when they took the air while being chased by a media pack? And - at the end of the day - who was really walking who? Now, in his own words, Roy Keane's dog tells the extraordinary story of their friendship and reveals his part in the glories and controversies that marked his master's career. From his arrival through a small ad in the South Manchester Advertiser through to Keane's final days as manager of Ipswich Town, the brilliant but neurotic Triggs was never far from his side, directing events as best he could. He was just a pup when he discovered, while watching television one day in 1998, that he could read a football march 'like a virtuoso can read a five-line staff'. But the brilliant but illness-obsessed dog always preferred to avoid the headlines and leave the adulation to his master. Until now. Ten major trophies. A missed Champions League final. Player of the Year awards. Alf-Inge Haaland. Drunken nights. Contract negotiations. Patrick Vieira. Prawn sandwiches. The explosive end to his relationships with Ireland and Manchester United. Triggs was witness to it all - and a far from silent one. Funny, frank and never less than one hundred and ten per cent mean-spirited, Triggs tells the truth about what it was like to be a central player in the extraordinary drama of his master's life. -Description from Amazon.co.uk",1409144992,9781409144991,400,Triggs, , ,3.53,47,8,Orion Publishing Group,June 14th 2012,Paperback,English,707-15062766-triggs.html

Written under obedience to her superiors, St. Margaret reveals the intimate spiritual life of a magnificent saint to whom Our Lord gave the famous revelations regarding the love of His Sacred Heart. Our Lord guided her from her earliest childhood and indicated to her how He cannot tolerate the slightest fault. He revealed to her the absolute sanctity of His love, and urged her not to resist His Holy Will in any way. She writes how God gave her a supernatural desire for great and continual suffering and love of the Cross. She tells us of angels appearing to her and how on another occasion she was given a mystical crown of thorns which caused her intense pain for the rest of her life.

When I almost died it was just after midday. We'd finished for the day and I was on the open-back truck we use as a school bus. There were no windows, just thick plastic sheeting that flapped at the sides and a postage stamp of open sky at the back through which I caught a glimpse of a kite wheeling up and down.

3654,Every Man A King: The Autobiography Of Huey P. Long,"Huey Long (1893–1935) was one of the most extraordinary American politicians, simultaneously cursed as a dictator and applauded as a benefactor of the masses. A product of the poor north Louisiana hills, he was elected governor of Louisiana in 1928, and proceeded to subjugate the powerful state political hierarchy after narrowly defeating an impeachment attempt. The only Southern popular leader who truly delivered on his promises, he increased the miles of paved roads and number of bridges in Louisiana tenfold and established free night schools and state hospitals, meeting the huge costs by taxing corporations and issuing bonds. Soon Long had become the absolute ruler of the state, in the process lifting Louisiana from near feudalism into the modern world almost overnight, and inspiring poor whites of the South to a vision of a better life. As Louisiana Senator and one of Roosevelt's most vociferous critics, ""The Kingfish,"" as he called himself, gained a nationwide following, forcing Roosevelt to turn his New Deal significantly to the left. But before he could progress farther, he was assassinated in Baton Rouge in 1935. Long's ultimate ambition, of course, was the presidency, and it was doubtless with this goal in mind that he wrote this spirited and fascinating account of his life, an autobiography every bit as daring and controversial as was The Kingfish himself.",0306806959,9780306806957,412,Huey Pierce Long,T.

3655,When Memory Speaks: Exploring the Art of Autobiography,"J ill Ker Conway, one of our most admired autobiographers--author of The Road from Coorain and True North--looks astutely and with feeling into the modern memoir: the forms and styles it assumes, and the strikingly different ways in which men and women respectively tend to understand and present their lives. In a narrative rich with evocations of memoirists over the centuries--from Jean-Jacques Rousseau and George Sand to W. E. B. Du Bois, Virginia Woolf, Frank McCourt and Katharine Graham--the author suggests why it is that we are so drawn to the reading of autobiography, and she illuminates the cultural assumptions behind the ways in which we talk about ourselves. Conway traces the narrative patterns typically found in autobiographies by men to the tale of the classical Greek hero and his epic journey of adventure. She shows how this configuration evolved, in memoirs, into the passionate romantic struggling against the conventions of society, into the frontier hero battling the wilderness, into self-made men overcoming economic obstacles to create an invention or a fortune--or, more recently, into a quest for meaning, for an understandable past, for an ethnic identity. In contrast, she sees the designs that women commonly employ for their memoirs as evolving from the writings of the mystics--such as Dame Julian of Norwich or St. Teresa of Avila--about their relationship with an all-powerful God. As against the male autobiographer's expectation of power over his fate, we see the woman memoirist again and again believing that she lacks command of her destiny, and tending to censor her own story. Throughout, Conway underlines the memoir's magic quality of allowing us to enter another human being's life and mind--and how this experience enlarges and instructs our own lives.

3665,Father Of The Blues: An Autobiography,"W. C. Handy's blues—“Memphis Blues,"" ""Beale Street Blues,"" ""St. Louis Blues""—changed America's music forever. In Father of the Blues, Handy presents his own story: a vivid picture of American life now vanished. W. C. Handy (1873–1958) was a sensitive child who loved nature and music; but not until he had won a reputation did his father, a preacher of stern Calvinist faith, forgive him for following the ""devilish"" calling of black music and theater. Here Handy tells of this and other struggles: the lot of a black musician with entertainment groups in the turn-of-the-century South; his days in minstrel shows, and then in his own band; how he made his first $100 from ""Memphis Blues""; how his orchestra came to grief with the First World War; his successful career in New York as publisher and song writer; his association with the literati of the Harlem Renaissance.Handy's remarkable tale—pervaded with his unique personality and humor—reveals not only the career of the man who brought the blues to the world's attention, but the whole scope of American music, from the days of the old popular songs of the South, through ragtime to the great era of jazz.",0306804212,9780306804212,340,W.C.

3670,The Autobiography of Jack the Ripper,"This memoir was recently discovered and appears to have been written in the 1920s by somone who asserts that he was Jack the Ripper. This person is James Carnac, this memoir written shortly before his death is an account of his entire life, including a few short months in 1888 when he became the murderer known to posterity as Jack the Ripper. This book introduces a new suspect for the infamous murders in Whitechapel in 1888. There is information in this book that does not appear to be derived from contemporary newspapers or any other publications and the descriptions of Tottenham in the 1870s, the visits to performances of Jekyll and Hyde, the intricate geography of Whitechapel in 1888 are written with pin-point accuracy. There is also a credible motive given for James becoming the murderer Jack and also a reason for the end of the murders. Given the fact that the author also appear to have knowledge about aspects of the case not in the public arena at the time it could be that this actually is the autobiography of Jack the Ripper. Ultimately it is up to the reader to decide if they believe the mystery has been solved at last but even if they end up deciding the account to be a work of fiction it would still be one of the very earliest imaginings of the Ripper case, written in the early years of the twentieth century, a fascinating piece of period writing and a worthy addition to the Ripper canon. Whatever side they come down on there is no question that this book will be a source of much debate.",0552165395,9780552165396,432,James Carnac, , ,3.30,442,92,Corgi,October 11th 2012,Paperback,English,73-15796726-the-autobiography-of-jack-the-ripper.html

3672,Vanity Will Get You Somewhere: An Autobiography,"Vanity Will Get You Somewhere is a generous, loving and humorous portrait of a man without a shred of vanity in his natureand of his friends and colleagues in the larger-than-life world of show business. Joseph Cotten s story begins in Tidewater, Virginia, moves on to an episode as a Miami potato salad tycoon and then brings us to his first big break as an actor in the New York theatre. Cotten describes how he met the flamboyant Orson Wellesat a radio audition at which Welles set a wastepaper basket on fireand their involvement with the Mercury theatre. This led to Cotten s first film role, as Orson s co-star in Citizen Kane, quickly followed by parts in The Magnificent Ambersons and The Third Man. Orsonperhaps the only man to use Churchill as a stooge while trying to set up a film dealwas a lifelong friend of Cotten s, and this autobiography was one of the last works he read before his untimely death in 1985. Cotten takes us behind the scenes of his stage plays and films, recalling amusing and intimate stories of his adventures with Ingrid Bergman, Marilyn Monroe, Katharine Hepburn, David Niven, David O. Selznick, Alfred Hitchcock and many others. Sensitive to his own motivations, frank about his marriages and warmly revealing about himself and his friends, Cotten has written much more than the usual film star biography. His skills as an actor have made him a master of character and dramatic momentum, and he brings the same talents to his writing. Vanity Will Get You Somewhere is a generous, loving and humorous portrait of a man without a shred of vanity in his natureand of his friends and colleagues in the larger-than-life world of show business.

After becoming a stage actor he joined the Mercury Theatre with Orson Welles, which led him to Hollywood and starring roles in 60 films, including Citizen Kane, The Third Man, Shadow of a Doubt and Gaslight.",0595091334,9780595091331,280,Joseph Cotten, , ,3.67,40,6,iUniverse,July 1st 2000,Paperback,English,731-548947.Vanity_Will_Get_You_Somewhere.html

3677,Buck 'Em!: The Autobiography of Buck Owens,"(Book). Buck 'Em! The Autobiography of Buck Owens is the life story of a country music legend. Born in Texas and raised in Arizona, Buck eventually found his way to Bakersfield, California. Unlike the vast majority of country singers, songwriters, and musicians who made their fortunes working and living in Nashville, the often rebellious and always independent Owens chose to create his own brand of country music some 2,000 miles away from Music City racking up a remarkable twenty-one number one hits along the way. In the process he helped give birth to a new country sound and did more than any other individual to establish Bakersfield as a country music center. In the latter half of the 1990s, Buck began working on his autobiography. Over the next few years, he talked into the microphone of a cassette tape machine for nearly one hundred hours, recording the story of his life. With his near-photographic memory, Buck recalled everything from his early days wearing hand-me-down clothes in Texas to his glory years as the biggest country star of the 1960s; from his legendary Carnegie Hall concert to his multiple failed marriages; from his hilarious exploits on the road to the tragic loss of his musical partner and best friend, Don Rich; from his days as the host of a local TV show in Tacoma, Washington, to his co-hosting the network television show Hee Haw; and from his comeback hit, ""Streets of Bakersfield,"" to his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In these pages, Buck also shows his astute business acumen, having been among the first country artists to create his own music publishing company. He also tells of negotiating the return of all of his Capitol master recordings, his acquisition of numerous radio stations, and of his conceiving and building the Crystal Palace, one of the most venerated musical venues in the country. Buck 'Em! is the fascinating story of the life of country superstar Buck Owens from the back roads of Texas to the streets of Bakersfield.

In the first volume of his autobiography, The Big Sea, covering the years through 1931, Hughes offers recollections of his childhood in Kansas, his high school years in Cleveland, his sojourn with his father in Mexico, and his initial reactions to New York City and Harlem. Commentaries on the ""Black Renaissance"" in Harlem and Washington, D.C., are intertwined with recollections of his student years at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, his travels through the South, and his association as a ""younger generation"" poet with the New York and Harlem literary establishment represented by the magazines Crisis and Opportunity.

Hughes addresses such controversial issues as his literary and personal disagreements with Zora Neale Hurston over their play Mule Bone, Carl Van Vechten's problematic novel Nigger Heaven, racial matters at Lincoln University, the Jim Crow laws in the South, and the failures of white patronage. Furthermore, Hughes refers to the sources of a blues poetry aesthetic, his visit to Cuba, and the struggle to complete his first novel, Not without Laughter.

From first kisses and broken hearts to pillow fights and legal battles to losing friends and finding strength in God, Beyoncé Knowles, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams share it all. Their example of survival has made Destiny's Child one of the most beloved, bestselling female groups ever. Here for the first time, the three share the struggles that have made them stronger, from Beyoncé's battles with weight loss and shyness, Kelly's coming to terms with growing up without a dad, and Michelle's triumph over grade-school bullies. They've grown up under the media microscope, and have had to deal with lineup changes and media rumors. Now they set the record straight. The demands and drama, the schedules and scrutiny -- from the tour bus to the dressing rooms to backstage at awards shows, Beyoncé, Kelly, and Michelle talk about what it takes to be successful. Whether it's changing outfits in the rain, changing their hair color, or changing a name, they've done it.

When these ladies had only minutes of studio time to work with Wyclef Jean to remix one of their songs, they didn't stress, they just started singing faster -- and the result was a unique sound that put them on the map.

Born to Ride , Stephen Roche’s first full autobiography, uses his best year as the starting point to explore the rest of his life. He doesn’t hold back as he examines the many ups and downs of his time on and off the bike, scrutinising victories, defeats, rivals, serious injury, doping allegations and agonizing family breakdown. At the heart of the book lies an enigma. For all his charm and rare, natural talent, beneath the surface lies an incredible tenacity and determination. Roche finally reveals himself as a smiling assassin; a master-strategist who lives to attack.",0224091905,9780224091909,320,Stephen Roche, , ,3.34,47,8,Yellow Jersey,June 7th 2012,Hardcover,English,742-13536495-born-to-ride.html
3685,My Escape: An Autobiography,"This witty autobiography captures the rich and varied life of a renowned French author and pioneering feminist, through the obstacles and movements in twentieth-century France. Born in 1920 in Paris, Benoite Groult obtained the right to vote only when she was twenty-five years old. She married four times, bore three children, underwent several illegal abortions, became a writer after she turned forty, and a feminist in her fifties. Groult chronicles her experiences and her intellectual developments through successive phases—as an obedient child, an awkward and bookish adolescent, and a submissive wife—until finally becoming a liberated novelist. Here, she recounts the childhood trips she spent with her family, Paris during the occupation, her marriages, motherhood, and her continuous fight for women’s rights. At ninety-one years old, she concludes that she has been, and still is, a happy woman—lucky to have captured her freedoms, one by one, paying for them, delighting in them, and loving them. Sexy, chatty, and full of shrewd insight, My Escape covers her years of struggle and success—as a daughter, lover, writer, wife, mother, and reluctant socialite—and draws a portrait of the role of French women in the twentieth century.",1590515439,9781590515433,384,Benoîte Groult, , ,3.41,29,6,Other Press,October 23rd 2012,Paperback,English,743-13330380-my-escape.html
3686,All Out! An Autobiography,"This candid autobiography, the last work by renowned psychologist Albert Ellis, is a tour de force of stimulating ideas, colorful descriptions of memorable people and events, and straightforward, no-nonsense talk. Ellis, the creator of one of the most successful forms of psychotherapy—Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT)—recounts the memorable episodes of his life; discusses how he coped with emotional problems at different stages of life; describes his love life; and subjects his own self-description to a ruthlessly honest critique. The heart of Ellis’s book is his analysis of the psychological leitmotifs that have appeared again and again throughout his life. He describes the aim of this autobiography as follows: ""As far as I can, I shall present my bad and good, stupid and intelligent, weak and strong points. Why? Because, following H. G. Wells’s recommendation, I want to go as all-out as I can. I want to acknowledge my idiocies—and use REBT to feel sorry about but unashamed of them. I want to make the point—again a central tenet of REBT—that all humans are fabulously fallible—including, of course, me. We have no real choice about this, but we can unconditionally accept ourselves—our so-called essence or being—with our fallibility. That will momentously help us, probably encourage us to acquire unconditional self-acceptance (USA) and possibly inspire other people to give it to themselves, too."" With a concluding chapter by Ellis’s widow, Debbie Joffe Ellis, describing the final years of his life, this is the definitive summation of the life and work of one of psychology’s most successful thinkers and practitioners.",1591024528,9781591024521,668,Albert Ellis, , ,3.33,12,1,Prometheus Books,October 30th 2009,Hardcover,English,744-410038.All_Out_An_Autobiography.html

3688,Mark Twain's Own Autobiography: The Chapters from the North American Review,"Mark Twain’s Own Autobiography stands as the last of Twain’s great yarns. Here he tells his story in his own way, freely expressing his joys and sorrows, his affections and hatreds, his rages and reverence—ending, as always, tongue-in-cheek: “Now, then, that is the tale. Some of it is true.” More than the story of a literary career, this memoir is anchored in the writer’s relation to his family—what they meant to him as a husband, father, and artist. It also brims with many of Twain’s best comic anecdotes about his rambunctious boyhood in Hannibal, his misadventures in the Nevada territory, his notorious Whittier birthday speech, his travels abroad, and more. Twain published twenty-five “Chapters from My Autobiography” in the North American Review in 1906 and 1907. “I intend that this autobiography . . . shall be read and admired a good many centuries because of its form and method—form and method whereby the past and the present are constantly brought face to face, resulting in contrasts which newly fire up the interest all along, like contact of flint with steel.” For this second edition, Michael Kiskis’s introduction references a wealth of critical work done on Twain since 1990. He also adds a discussion of literary domesticity, locating the autobiography within the history of Twain’s literary work and within Twain’s own understanding and experience of domestic concerns.",0299234746,9780299234744,392,Mark Twain,Michael J.

3691,Lay Bare the Heart: An Autobiography of the Civil Rights Movement,"Texas native James Farmer is one of the “Big Four” of the turbulent 1960s civil rights movement, along with Martin Luther King Jr., Roy Wilkins, and Whitney Young. Farmer might be called the forgotten man of the movement, overshadowed by Martin Luther King Jr., who was deeply influenced by Farmer’s interpretation of Gandhi’s concept of nonviolent protest. Born in Marshall, Texas, in 1920, the son of a preacher, Farmer grew up with segregated movie theaters and “White Only” drinking fountains. This background impelled him to found the Congress of Racial Equality in 1942. That same year he mobilized the first sit-in in an all-white restaurant near the University of Chicago. Under Farmer’s direction, CORE set the pattern for the civil rights movement by peaceful protests which eventually led to the dramatic “Freedom Rides” of the 1960s. In Lay Bare the Heart Farmer tells the story of the heroic civil rights struggle of the 1950s and 1960s. This moving and unsparing personal account captures both the inspiring strengths and human weaknesses of a movement beset by rivalries, conflicts and betrayals. Farmer recalls meetings with Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, Jack and Bobby Kennedy, Adlai Stevenson (for whom he had great respect), and Lyndon Johnson (who, according to Farmer, used Adam Clayton Powell Jr., to thwart a major phase of the movement). James Farmer has courageously worked for dignity for all people in the United States. In this book, he tells his story with forthright honesty. First published in 1985 by Arbor House, this edition contains a new foreword by Don Carleton, director of the Dolph BriscoeCenter for American History at the University of Texas at Austin, and a new preface.",0875651887,9780875651880,370,James Farmer,Don Carleton, ,4.25,56,8,Texas Christian University Press,June 1st 1998,Paperback,English,749-2146691.Lay_Bare_the_Heart.html
3692,Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper,"With more than sixty confirmed kills, Jack Coughlin is the Marine Corps' top-ranked sniper. Shooter is his harrowing first-person account of a sniper's life on and off the modern battlefield. Gunnery Sgt. Jack Coughlin is a divorced father of two who grew up in a wealthy Boston suburb. At the age of nineteen, although he had never even held a gun, he joined the Marines and would spend the next twenty years behind the scope of a long-range precision rifle as a sniper. In that time he accumulated one of the most successful sniper records in the Corps, ranging through many of the world's hotspots. During Operation Iraqi Freedom alone, he recorded at least thirty-six kills, thirteen of them in a single twenty-four-hour period. Now Coughlin has written a highly personal story about his deadly craft, taking readers deep inside an invisible society that is off-limits to outsiders. This is not a heroic battlefield memoir, but the careful study of an exceptional man who must keep his sanity while carrying forward one of the deadliest legacies in the U.S. military today.",0312336853,9780312336851,304,Jack Coughlin,Donald A.

3694,Mr Nastase: The Autobiography,"The amazing life story of the enfant terrible of tennis in the 1970s and 80s - winner of two Grand Slam titles, three Grand Slam doubles titles and twice a Wimbledon finalist. It is not an overstatement to say that Ilie Nastase was in part responsible for the explosion of interest in tennis in the seventies. Thanks to his success, his lifestyle, his sex appeal and the controversy that continually surrounded him, Nastase's name was recognisable far beyond the confines of tennis. Yet, he also had a dark side and he regularly got himself into trouble with umpires and spectators alike. His court-side tantrums and manic questioning of line calls could spiral out of control and, all too often, he found himself fined and disqualified - and making the next day's front pages. Bjorn Borg had great difficulty adjusting to life after retirement and lost vast amounts of money, while the late Vitas Gerulaitis had a major cocaine problem. Ilie reveals how he helped both of them at a time when their problems were taking a huge toll on their personal lives. He also provides opinions and anecdotes on a host of other characters, including John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors and Arthur Ashe, Henri Leconte, Yannick Noah, Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova. As a result of his celebrity status, Nastase moved amongst the beautiful people. His book recalls some of his more memorable encounters and experiences, including dancing the night away in New York's Studio 54 and Castel in Paris with the likes of Bianca Jagger and Claudia Cardinale, and bedding some of the world's most desirable women (an Italian countess and a former Miss UK are among his conquests). For the many sports fans who followed tennis and followed his career, his stories behind the varied headline-grabbing outbursts will prove fascinating and irresistible.",0007336977,9780007336975,434,Ilie Nastase, , ,3.70,37,1,HarperCollins Publishers,August 1st 2009,Paperback,English,751-9666286-mr-nastase.html

3698,A Journey to Waco: Autobiography of a Branch Davidian,"Nearly twenty years after they happened, the ATF and FBI assaults on the Branch Davidian residence near Waco, Texas remain the most deadly law enforcement action on American soil. The raid by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms agents on February 28, 1993, which resulted in the deaths of four ATF agents and six Branch Davidians, precipitated a 51-day siege conducted by the FBI. The FBI tank and gas assault on the residence at Mount Carmel Center on April 19 culminated in a fire that killed 53 adults and 23 children, with only nine survivors. In A Journey to Waco, survivor Clive Doyle not only takes readers inside the tragic fire and its aftermath, but he also tells the larger story of how and why he joined the Branch Davidians, how the Branch Davidian community developed, and the status of survivors. While the media and official reports painted one picture of the Branch Davidians and the two assaults, A Journey to Waco shares a much more personal account of the ATF raid, the siege, and the final assault that details events unreported by the media. A Journey to Waco presents what the Branch Davidians believed and introduces readers to the community s members, including David Koresh. A Journey to Waco is a personal account of one man s journey with the Branch Davidians, through the tragic fire, and beyond.""",1442208856,9781442208858,298,Clive Doyle,Catherine Wessinger,Matthew Wittmer,3.24,17,3,Rowman & Littlefield Publishers,August 17th 2012,Hardcover,English,755-14366147-a-journey-to-waco.html

Bush offers readers an intimate, plainspoken, and often readable look at the character-shaping achievements that led to his inevitable rise to the office of President of the United States.Written from the heart, not from the brain, this definitive autobiography takes readers on a journey through the 43rd President's life, including his hardscrabble beginnings as the child of West Texas oil millionaires, the remarkable academic performance that earned him entry into the finest East Coast schools, and his proud service to the country as an occasional member of the National Guard sometime around 1972 or 1973. He proudly recounts his years as a successful oil-business failure and the owner of a baseball team. He even dares to dream the ultimate dream: to become Commissioner of Baseball. The great man we meet here displays his mother's steely resolve and vindictive temper, his father's keen mastery of language, and his own unique gift of deciding. His gripping life story deepens when a faith in God hits him one day ""like a bottle of Jack on an empty stomach,"" and he has an encounter with the Prince of Peace that sets George W. Bush on a path to become the greatest War President in history. To help craft this lasting account of his life and leadership, George W. Bush turned to two writers who have earned not only his trust but his deep friendship: Scott Dikkers, editor-in-chief of ""The Onion"" and coauthor of the #1 bestseller ""Our Dumb Century,"" and Peter Hilleren, former producer for public radio and some of the nation's finest public-access cable-television stations. Dikkers and Hilleren call on their finely honed journalism expertise everyweek to write and record the President's weekly radio address on WeeklyRadioAddress.com.

3708,Dalo: The Autobiography,"Anthony Daly was the most successful captain in the history of Clare hurling, leading the county to two All-Irelands and three Munster titles. Regarded as an inspirational figure by his fellow players, Daly’s innate leadership and character prompted the Clare players, just three years after he had finished his playing career, to pursue him as manager at the age of just 34. During his three years in charge, he took Clare to the cusp of two All-Ireland finals, agonisingly losing the 2005 and 2006 semi-finals to the eventual winners, Cork and Kilkenny. It was that kind of ambition and drive to succeed which attracted Dublin hurling to Daly. Taking over the county in 2009, he led Dublin, in 2011, to their first National League title in 72 years and, in 2013, their first Leinster title in 52 years, before he retired as manager in September 2014. Dalo takes us from the early days growing up in Clarecastle through the early part of his career with Clare, the golden years and the extension into management, punctuated with intense and revealing stories from the dressing-room. Interlaced with drama, tragedy, his love of other pursuits, and his immense wit, Anthony Daly’s autobiography offers a compelling insight into a unique personality in modern Irish sport.",1448152518,9781448152513,0,Anthony Daly, , ,4.06,18,1,Transworld Digital,October 30th 2014,ebook, ,764-23350977-dalo.html

His impassioned speeches incited riots, his reasoned writings defined and codified religious beliefs, and his candid disclosures of Utah history brought him both respect and censure. He is best remembered today as a largely self-educated intellectual. Several of his landmark published works are still in print more than fifty years after his death. His life story, told here in his own words and published for the first time, may well stand as his greatest, most enduring achievement. For many today, B. H. Roberts is the quintessential Mormon intellectual of the twentieth century. But his theological writings came late in life and his historical views were more subjective than definitive. His autobiography, on the other hand, is a forthright account of the events and acquaintances that contributed to his unique faith and intellectual independence. Troubled by the memory of being abandoned as a child, and of the abusive care of quarrelling and intemperate foster-parents, he survived a stormy youth of poverty and neglect. He describes his nearly ten years as a missionary to the southern United States, his subsequent tenure as an outspoken member of the First Quorum of Seventy, his public opposition to women’s suffrage, and his controversial bid for the U.S. House of Representatives as a Mormon polygamist.",1560850051,9781560850052,284,B.H.

3713,The Lost Library: The Autobiography of a Culture,"Born in Berlin at the end of the nineteenth century, Walter Mehring inherited both his father’s respect for the civilizing power of literature and his formidable library of thousands of books. Like his father, believed that books and reading were essential to progress, mutual understanding, and contentment. After having served in World War I, Mehring spent the years between the world wars as part of the exhilarating avant-garde coffeehouse culture of Europe’s capitals; he himself was a poet, cabaret lyricist, and founder of the Dadaist movement in Berlin. But with the rise of fascism, Europe became a dangerous place for free-thinking artists. Mehring never envisioned that the culture of books celebrated in his father’s library would be rejected by the sudden rise to prominence of the Nationalist Socialist Party. Soon, even his own books were burned by the Brownshirts and Mehring was forced to roam Europe as a literary fugitive. From a precarious exile in Vienna, he arranged for his father’s books to be smuggled out of Germany, but their fate would be worse than his—while Mehring managed to slip out of Austria and avoid capture, his library was confiscated and destroyed by the Nazis in 1938. In The Lost Library: The Autobiography of a Culture, translated by Richard and Clara Winston and presented in paperback for the first time, Mehring takes the reader with him as he unpacks the crates of books in his mind, and in the process recalls what each book meant to him and his father. Writing with wit and insight, Mehring successfully compares the humanism of his father’s era with the chaos of Europe at war, using his father’s library as a metaphor for how the optimism of nineteenth-century progress gave way to the disorder and book-burning of the twentieth.Times Literary Supplement",, ,290,Walter Mehring, , ,3.69,13,3,The Bobbs-Merrill Compan,1951,Hardcover,English,769-8574842-the-lost-library.html

It is at its heart one of the greatest business stories ever told. The most versatile Founding Father was a husband, a father, a writer, an inventor, a statesman, a fundraiser and a military leader. But in his mind, he was first and foremost a businessman. Franklin's captivating adventures include his almost single-handed responsibility for establishing the first media empire, the first public library, the first fire brigade, the University of Pennsylvania, the first book club and the first franchise--all of which are detailed within these pages with Franklin's characteristic mix of humility and pride. Franklin chronicles his own story, from his early days growing up in colonial Boston to his retirement from printing and growing involvement in national politics. It was during these years that he honed his management and leadership skills, acquired a fervent distaste for tyranny of all types, embraced a strong set of morals, and developed an uncompromising work ethic. From the moment he fled his tyrannical master and set himself up as a printer in Philadelphia, all who came into contact with Franklin recognized his destiny.

He was nearly nine years old before he realized that being different from his white playmates was of any real significance.An incident at a local drugstore marked the beginning of what would be a painful rite of passage from an idyllic childhood through a tormented adolescence as Ely struggled to understand why he could not wholly belong to either his father's world or his mother's.

3735,Banksy: My Autobiography,"Gordon Banks would take the No 1 shirt in many people's all-time world's best XI, but as told in Banksy: My Autobiography , the ""cat"" who had even Pele shaking his head in admiration, struggled against illness and accident during his career, and found the going tough once he'd hung up his gloves. The England mainstay, whose 17-year career in British football was spent with just three clubs, reflects on a very different game than today's big-money business. As Banks tells it, goalkeeping was a different business too--no gloves, no Kevlar-reinforced elbow pads, half the domestic season played in ankle deep mud, and very little official protection from the marauding centre forwards who prided themselves on serving the keeper a full mid-air body check early in a game. Wits and courage mattered, as much as technique, and with goalkeeping coaches unheard of, Banks recalls that he was forced to learn his craft out on the pitch--not always with success. He became a master, of course, whose exploits are part of the game's folklore--the save-of-all-time against Brazil in 1970; George Best flicking the ball out of his hands to ""score"" in 1971; the 1972 car crash that robbed him of sight in one eye, and that 1966 World Cup triumph. There's humour too, notably the episode when, furthering his playing career in the emerging US super league, Banks is examined by a Stateside club doctor, who struggles with the idea that an athlete who's got several metal plates in his body, can't quite touch his toes, and has no vision in one eye, could really by an asset to the team--let alone a goalkeeping great. But whatever plaudits Banks received as a player, retirement was far from plain sailing. An ill-fated career in management followed, which ended in farce when Telford United dismissed Banks, but unwilling, or unable to pay off the remains of his contract, tried to force the World Cup hero to resign by assigning him to sell raffle tickets from a concession booth the club leased in a local supermarket. Happier times were to follow, notably as a member of the Pools Panel, but this part of the Banks' story, including his decision to sell off his 1966 winner's medal and memorabilia, is largely glossed over--an absence that is a poignant counterpoint to his reflections on the glory years. -- Alex Hankin",0141011254,9780141011257,464,Gordon Banks, , ,3.76,21,5,Penguin Books Ltd,July 31st 2003,Paperback,English,789-51247.Banksy.html

3738,The Compleated Autobiography 1757-1790,"Benjamin Franklin's celebrated Autobiography, published after his death, is one of the greatest autobiographies of all time ... but it was incomplete. Franklin ended his life's story in 1757, when he was only fifty-one. He planned to write more-a lot more, but never did. He lived another thirty-three full, eventful, and dramatic years, some of the most dramatic years in American history, years in which Franklin was America's advocate in London, represented Pennsylvania in the Continental Congress, and was America's wartime ambassador to France. During these years Franklin also helped write our nation's Constitution and planned an American Empire that would displace the British Empire. Franklin is one of the most fascinating of the Founding Fathers-a polymath like Jefferson, a practical statesman like Washington, and a cynic and wit beyond parallel. Now, at last, in The Compleated Autobiography by Benjamin Franklin, we finally get the rest of the story, in Franklin's own words.

It will describe his early TV work and movies, among them Roger Corman’s The Intruder, a movie about racism filmed in the south in 1961; Kingdom of the Spiders, in which he costarred with 30,000 tarantulas; and Incubus, the only film ever made in the language of Esperanto. It will include his private life, including the complete story of the drowning death of his third wife. It will include stories from three other series, T.J. Hooker, Rescue 911—which saved more than 240 lives—and Boston Legal, as well as his work on Third Rock from the Sun, for which he won his first Emmy for playing “the Big Giant Head.” And of course, it will include the story of Star Trek; how it came about and how it affected him—and fans—concluding with the story of a taxi driver who told Shatner he’d been a prisoner in Vietnam and that pretending they were the Star Trek crew kept him and his fellow inmates sane. And yes, it will include his singing and commercials and quiz show hosting and award show hosting and the greatest practical joke ever played, Invasion, Iowa, not to mention the story about Shatner being invited into a cage with Koko the Gorilla—who wanted to take him back to her bedcage. After almost 60 years, William Shatner has become one of our most beloved entertainers. And as evidenced by Comedy Central’s roast, “The Shat Hits the Fan,” Shatner gets the joke. For the first time, William Shatner shares with listeners the remarkable, full story of his life.",1427204152,9781427204158,0,William Shatner,David  Fisher, ,3.79,1906,330,Macmillan Audio,May 13th 2008,Audio CD,English,795-2316750.Up_Till_Now.html

She had a reputation as a fiercely independent thinker and champion of causes, particularly those of her beloved homeland, Ireland. In 'Tis Herself, O'Hara recounts her extraordinary life and proves to be just as strong, sharp, and captivating as any character she played on-screen. O'Hara was brought to Hollywood as a teenager in 1939 by the great Charles Laughton, to whom she was under contract, to costar with him in the classic film The Hunchback of Notre Dame. She has appeared in many other classics, including How Green Was My Valley, Rio Grande, The Quiet Man, and Miracle on 34th Street. She recalls intimate memories of working with the actors and directors of Hollywood's Golden Age, including Laughton, Alfred Hitchcock, Tyrone Power, James Stewart, Henry Fonda, and John Candy. With characteristic frankness, she describes her tense relationship with the mercurial director John Ford, with whom she made five films, and her close lifelong friendship with her frequent costar John Wayne. Successful in her career, O'Hara was less lucky in love until she met aviation pioneer Brigadier General Charles F. Blair, the great love of her life, who died in a mysterious plane crash ten years after their marriage.

3745,Himself: The Autobiography of a Hindu Lady,"Himself: The Autobiography of a Hindu Lady, Translated and Adapted by Katherine Van Akin Gates from a book written in the Marathi language by Mrs. Ramabai Ranade, founder of the Seva Sadan Society, one of the first organizations to introduce educational, medical and social service for women in India. This is a true story of real people. They lived in Western India during the latter part of the last century. Mrs. Ramabai Ranade introduces herself as a spoiled little girl of eleven, and explains why she has remained unmarried for so long. At that time her father arranged with Mr. Ranade's father for her marriage to his son. This son was already a graduate of University and Law School, a member of the Bar and a judge in a lower court, a mature, gifted man of thirty-two who was married to an illiterate eleven year old. The story follows the young wife through the years of her adjustment and education, showing the discipline afforded her by the joint family system. Her husband insisted on teaching her both Marathi and English, and training her to take part in the educational and social reforms which he sponsored. How these two people, in spite of discrepancy in age and educational equipment, succeed in creating a happy home and in establishing a splendid relationship between themselves, is the thread of intense human interest which weaves the story together. Although different from Western ideas, this ideal Indian womanhood, as it comes to us through the experience of this gifted woman of another race, has universal appeal.

It was a bowdlerized edition: Darwin's family, attempting to protect his posthumous reputation, had deleted all the passages they considered too personal or controversial. The present complete edition did not appear until 1959, one hundred years after the publication of The Origin of Species . Upon its appearance, Loren Eiseley wrote: ""No man can pretend to know Darwin who does not know his autobiography. Here, for the first time since his death, it is presented complete and unexpurgated, as it exists in the family archives. It will prove invaluable to biographers and cast new light on the personality of one of the world's greatest scientists. Nora Barlow, Darwin's granddaughter, has proved herself a superb editor. Her own annotations make fascinating reading."" The daring and restless mind, the integrity and simplicity of Darwin's character are revealed in this direct and personal account of his life—his family, his education, his explorations of the natural world, his religion and philosophy. The editor has provided page and line references to the more important restored passages, and previously unpublished notes and letters on family matters and on the controversy between Samuel Butler appear in an appendix.",0393310698,9780393310696,224,Charles Darwin,Nora Barlow, ,3.82,1035,95,W.W.

As the face of the 'The Midday Show', 'A Current Affair', '60 Minutes' and 'Carols by Candlelight', he is instantly recognisable. Indeed, after more than forty years on our television screens many people feel that they have come to know him. But not many people know the real story behind Ray's rise to stardom. His was an impoverished childhood; his world as far away from Hollywood and movie stars and the bright lights as is possible to imagine. Before he had even got to high school, Ray had lived in thirteen different places, in three Australian states, mostly in the bush. His father was a violent, drinking man who would lash out at his wife and children, ultimately forcing Ray's mother to uproot the family across to the other side of Australia to escape him. Far from being crushed by his difficult childhood, though, Ray drew strength from his remarkable mother and sisters, and developed an irrepressible sense of humour. Here, now, in his own words, is the long-awaited, warts-and-all autobiography of Ray Martin: his exceptional career, his happy marriage to Dianne and his lasting love affair with the people of Australia. Funny, thought-provoking and inspiring, this is the most compelling autobiography you will read this year.

3775,Hunger of Memory: The Education of Richard Rodriguez (An Autobiography),""" This is what matters to me: the story of the scholarship boy who returns home one summer from college to discover bewildering silence, facing his parents. This is my story. An American Story ."" Hunger of Memory is the story of Mexican-American Richard Rodriguez, who begins his schooling in Sacramento, California knowing just 50 words of English, and concludes his university studies in the stately quiet of the reading room of the British Museum. Here is the poignant journey of a ""minority student"" who pays the cost of his social assimilation and academic success with a painful alienation -- from his past, his parents, his culture -- and so describes the high price of ""making it"" in middle-class America. Provocative in its positions on affirmative action and bilingual education, Hunger of Memory is a powerful political statement, a profound study of the importance of language... and a moving, intimate portrait of a boy struggling to become a man. ""Arresting... Splendidly written intellectual autobiography."" THE BOSTON GLOBE ""Superb autobiographical essay... Mr. Rodriguez offers himself as an example of the long labor of change: its costs, about which he is movingly frank, its loneliness, but also its triumph.""

With a voice reminiscent of Pete Hamill's in A Drinking Life and a childhood as tough as Frank McCourt's in Angela's Ashes, he tells his story, full of wit, bravado, and Irish charm. We watch him change from altar boy to rebel ... then throw away a promising career in the theater. We follow him through his almost unbelievable adventures in the military ... through four marriages and countless lovers ... through the alcohol-fueled crimes that ultimately landed him in prison ... and, finally, through the ugly reality of the cancer that killed him. Along the way, we get a feel for the internal pain, the constant struggle of the ""low-bottom"" alky to make it from one day to the next.",0988336219,9780988336216,270,Kieran Doherty, , ,4.14,7,5,Cap & Bells Press,June 2013,Hardcover,English,826-18326182-back-from-the-abyss.html

3778,A Kick Against The Pricks: The Autobiography,"David Norris is one of Ireland’s most popular, colourful and charismatic public figures. Not a man to shy away from controversy, he has spent most of his adult life challenging the establishment, whether as a leading campaigner for gay rights, a passionate conservationist, an unconventional academic and Joycean scholar, a brilliant raconteur, or, since 1987, a fiercely independent Senator and outspoken defender of human rights.Born in the Belgian Congo to an English father, who died when he was six years old, and an Irish mother, who died when he was twenty-one, David has been a Dubliner all his life, and the city of Ulysses remains one of his great passions. He spear-headed the revival of Georgian Dublin, particularly through his campaign to save North Great George’s Street, where he has lived for the last thirty-five years.But it is David Norris’s campaign to decriminalize homosexuality that will stand as his major legacy. Over a long sixteen years, he fought a difficult battle to overturn the Victorian law, finally winning a historic victory in the European Court of Human Rights in 1988.David’s decision to run for President of Ireland in 2011 was not lightly taken, but it proved to be the most bruising period of his life. His popularity and the public affection in which he is held saw him quickly established as the front-runner. However, a sustained and hostile media campaign forced him out of the race; although he re-entered it in the autumn, the momentum had been lost. In these pages, David Norris reveals for the first time the full, no-holds-barred story of his presidential campaign, and of how he recovered from the turmoil.A Kick Against the Pricks is a brilliant, deeply revealing autobiography, a remarkable journey from the margins to the centre of Irish society.",1848271344,9781848271340,416,David   Norris, , ,4.09,22,4,Transworld Ireland,October 11th 2012,Hardcover,English,828-16097649-a-kick-against-the-pricks.html

3782,Matters Of Discretion: An Autobiography,"An absorbing, authentic and definitive account, by a former prime minister, of crucial events that had a significant impact on the nation’s destiny after independence. I K Gujral has penned his life story in a forthright and candid manner. He entered the political fray as a freedom fighter in the British era, and after the tumultuous events that rocked the Indian subcontinent in the wake of the partition in August 1947, crossed over from Pakistan to India, where he had to begin life from scratch. Despite facing tremendous odds, on the basis of his perseverance, resilience and never-say-die attitude, Gujral’s achievements allowed him to witness and shape India’s contemporary history. Gujral joined Congress Party and was first elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1964. He was the Information and Broadcasting Minister when emergency was imposed, which entailed arbitrary press censorship. Since he refused to bow down to the de facto powers, he was unceremoniously replaced and later sent by Indira Gandhi as India’s ambassador to the USSR, a post he handled with commendable tact and finesse. After his stint in Moscow, he returned to India and re-entered the ‘political whirlpool’ by joining the Janata Dal. He became minister for external affairs under V P Singh (1989) and Deve Gowda (1996). Gujral reached the pinnacle of his career when he became the prime minister on 1997. During his priministership, despite the exigencies and pressures of running a coalition government, he endeavoured to achieve progress in many spheres. The Gujral Doctrine (a set of five principles to guide the conduct of foreign relations with India’s immediate neighbours) was widely acclaimed in both India and the West. This volume, a valuable addition to the literature on contemporary history, provides a deep insight into the political scene as it unfolded after independence and delineates the roles played by a wide spectrum of politicians, bureaucrats, and many others.",9380480806,9789380480800,520,I.K.

3784,That Thing You Do With Your Mouth: The Sexual Autobiography of Samantha Matthews as Told to David Shields,"In That Thing You Do With Your Mouth, actress and voice-over artist Samantha Matthews offers—in the form of an extended monologue, prompted and arranged by New York Times bestselling author (and Matthews’s cousin once removed) David Shields—a vivid investigation of her startling sexual history. From her abuse at the hands of a family member to her present-day life in Barcelona, where she briefly moonlighted as a dubber of Italian pornography into English, Matthews reveals herself to be a darkly funny, deeply contemporary woman with a keen awareness of how her body has been routinely hijacked, and how she has been “formatted” by her early trauma. Her story is a study of her uneasy relationships with female desire, her tormentors, and her lovers—with whom she seeks out both the infliction and receipt of harm. This book is an attempt, sometimes self-thwarted, to break down barriers: sexual and emotional for Matthews, literary for Shields. For them, the only response to the unspeakable is to speak, to do that thing you do with your mouth, as directly and honestly as possible. Their provocative performance refuses neat resolution or emotional pornography; it will have readers, from literary critics to Jezebel commentators, raving, raging, celebrating, talking.",1940450640,9781940450643,160,David Shields,Samantha Matthews, ,3.43,58,8,"McSweeney's          ""]",June 9th 2015,Paperback, ,833-23493803-that-thing-you-do-with-your-mouth.html

It ranges from his earliest memories of his father's Midlands estate, through Eton, Oxford, and the Great War, to his defining moment: his installation as a Tory minister in the 1930s. A rotter and a chancer of the first order, Fox-Ingleby will do anything to get what he wants—power, money, and of course, lashings of the fairer sex. His memoir, an attempt to legitimize his detestable life, is prone to bouts of grand prolix and riddled with misogyny, bigotry, and more than the odd sleight of hand. Turning a perpetually blind eye to his devious and malicious acts, Fox-Ingleby chooses instead to portray himself as a gentleman misunderstood.

3800,Amen: The Autobiography of a Nun,"On 31 August 2008, Sister Jesme left the Congregation of Mother of Carmel. The authorities repeated attempts to have her declared insane, she says, left her no other option. This book, a first of its kind in India, is an outpouring of her experiences as a nun for thirty-three years. Spirited and fun-loving, from a good family, deeply-rooted in Catholicism, Jesme was drawn to religious life at seventeen after a Retreat at junior college. As a nun, seven years later, she felt distressed at the many ills growing inside the convent and being forced to remain silent about them. There was corruption, by way of donations for college seats; sexual relations between some priests and nuns, and between nuns; class distinctions whereby the cheduthies, or poorer and less-educated sisters, did menial jobs; and a wide gap between comforts and facilities enjoyed by the priests and nuns. Jesme was permitted to complete her doctorate in English Literature, to pursue her passion for literature, cinema and teaching college students. She exposed them to classic films, believing that aesthetics enhances spirituality. But these joys were clouded by the troubles she faced. Searing, sincere, and sensitive, Amen is a plea for a reformation of the Church and comes at a time of its growing concern about nuns and priests. It affirms Jesme’s unbroken spirit and faith in Jesus and the Church, living like a nun, but outside the Four Walls of the convent.",, ,192,Sister Jesme, , ,3.33,15,1,Penguin,June 18th 2009,Kindle Edition,English,848-20123146-amen.html

3809,With No Regrets - An Autobiography,"AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY Krishna Nehru And time remember d is grief forgotten An Asia Press Book The John Day Company New York FOREWORD I seldom consent to write a foreword, but as I have known Krishna Hutheesing since she was a child, I readily conceded her claim for my blessing on her sheaf of memories. She undertook this book, she tells us, to solace the loneliness of those long anxious months following on the black Sunday of August 1942 that saw so many national workers, including almost her entire family, in prison. With characteristic directness and complete candor, she recounts the tale of her own young life for she is still quite young. She speaks of her happy if wayward childhood in a home of wealth and beauty, of her somewhat difficult and sometimes rebellious girlhood in surroundings strangely and unbelievably altered by the influence of the meek but oh how mighty Mahatma, from a background of rich festivities to a battle camp of austere conflict and tremendous sacrifice. She gives us glimpses of her stay in Switzerland with an ailing sister-in-law, her travels with her father and brother in France and England, Germany and Russia, and mentions some famous people whom she met. She relates her experiences as a Satya grahi prisoner in a womens jail, and confides in us the romance of her unconventional courtship and marriage, her reactions to new modes of living in new cities and unfamiliar environments she presents to us her two small sons, Harsha and Ajit, for whose sakes she has been persuaded to refrain from an active share in the current political movement. Here and there the leaves are stained with tears of bereavement for father, mother and others dearly loved. But this verypersonal narrative is closely woven into die 7 fabric of the family history of the Nehrus. Therein, for the wider public, will lie its special value and appeal. Has the his tory of the Nehrus not been for a quarter of a century both a living symbol and an integral part of the story of the Indian struggle for freedom In this simple and intimate chronicle, we discover the mag nificent Motilal Nehru where shall we ever find his equal in his most endearing and delightful role as the benevolent and genial patriarch and dictator of an adoring family, whom he loved with a surpassing devotion which impressed Mahatma Gandhi as the most remarkable of his many great qualities. Here, Jawaharlal, that passionate and intrepid crusader for world causes, doffs his armor and sheathes his fiery sword, and proves himself an incomparable exponent of many-sided relationships as son and brother, husband, father, friend and perfect playmate of little children. Here, too, drawn in tender colors, is the portrait of Jawa hars lovely and heroic wife, Kamala, the pathos of whose brief life and the poignant tragedy of whose death have al ready passed into lyric and legend in the country. Swamp, now called Vijayalakshmi, winds her way through the pattern of this tale like a gleaming thread of silver and Indira floats before our eyes for a moment, a delicate vision in her saffron bridal robes. But to me most precious, perhaps, of all is the remembrance of that tiny and exquisite, aged and suffering woman, Motilals wife, Jawahars mother, in whom love and faith wrought so sweet a miracle of courage and endurance. She, who was care fully cherished and jealously guarded like a jewel in an ivory casket throughout herfragile youth and middle years, trans formed herself in her frail old age into a gem-like flame of inspiration to guide those whose feet were set irrevocably on the steep and perilous paths of freedom. Precious, too, is the pendant picture of that older sister, widowed in childhood, who dedicated her life to the tireless service of the Nehru household, and who, having fulfilled her 8 last duties to her sister, laid down her life within twenty-four hours after she died undivided in death as in life...",1406776610,9781406776614,164,Krishna Nehru Hutheesing, , ,4.40,5,2,Jackson Press,March 1st 2007,Paperback,English,856-6264545-with-no-regrets---an-autobiography.html
3810,My Autobiography,"Just before the start of the 2002 Wales v Scotland match in Cardiff, the stadium announcer asked people to stand and acknowledge Bill McLaren's great contribution to the sport. The whole ground rose, leaving McLaren choking back the tears. Then came a voice in his ear: 'Cue, Bill...' Coping with his emotions on that day was obviously not straightforward, even for a commentator of Bill McLaren's experience, used to being caught up in some of the most dramatic moments rugby has ever seen. But Bill also talks frankly about the greatest tragedy of his life: the death of his younger daughter from cancer at 46, the three years of agony and the trauma of her final day. Bill wanted to stay at her bedside but she insisted he go and carry out a commentating duty in Edinburgh on the Saturday afternoon. He did so, rushed back to the hospital, but she had died that afternoon while he was on air. McLaren, himself, had almost died of TB in his youth and he tells of the days and nights when he hid under the sheets in bed at the Scottish hospital where he was kept for 19 months, 'crying myself to sleep each night as they took away my friends who had died that day. I was certain I would be next'. He has excellent memories of his war years and delves deep to recall some harrowing times as a forward observation spotter when he came within inches of being killed by a German sniper. Later, he also remembers leading his men one day into a small northern Italian town where they discovered 1500 corpses piled up in the square. 'That was the day I became a man, rather quickly,' he says. He was 21. As well reliving the highlights of his illustrious career as a commentator, Bill talks of the game today and his regrets that rugby went professional. He is a fierce critic of what this has led to and fears for the future health and safety of rugby players because he regards the modern game as dangerously physical. His story amounts to a history of the game itself and reaffirms McLaren's status as something of a global treasure.",055381558X,9780553815580,400,Bill McLaren, , ,3.71,17,1,Bantam,November 1st 2005,Paperback,English,857-3157757-my-autobiography.html

To explore infinity, popularize the fourth dimension, seek the gnarl, become a beatnik writer, and father a family. All the while Rudy is reading science fiction and beat poetry, and beginning to write some pretty strange fiction of his own—a blend of Philip K.

3836,Autobiographies,"Since the publication of All Roads at Once in 1976, each of Alfred Corn's books has been praised for embodying an impressively wide range of subjects rendered with great technical skill. Autobiographies is his most surprising achievement to date. It opens with a group of lyric and reflective poems remarkable for their formal control and depth of feeling. There is, for example, a harrowing poem about Dracula told from the viewpoint of a young woman subject to his spell. The poems ""Coventry"" and ""Cannot Be a Tourist"" enact moments of recognition in other countries. The narrator's experience of being on his own in New York City after the end of a thirteen-year relationship is explored in ""Resolutions"" and ""La Madeleine,"" the latter following parallels in the life of Mary Magdalene and Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. ""Contemporary Culture and the Letter K"" charts twentieth-century experience up to the age of AIDS according to the fortunes of a single letter of the alphabet. The volume's long poem, ""1992,"" is an autobiographical narrative set in many different locations in the United States, with scenes from five decades of the author's life. These are placed beside brief, plangent narratives from imagined lives of a wide cast of characters: a Puerto Rican teenager living in New York, a young woman of the Havasupai tribe, a retired black artist in northern Ohio, a Wisconsin mother visiting a dying relative, a young man serving time for disorderly conduct in a New Hampshire jail. The cumulatively widening and deepening picture of autobiographical and imagined experience provides a vivid and varied account of late twentieth-century America up to the quincentennial year of Columbus's voyage. In decades to come, Autobiographies will be remembered as a bold and innovative turning point in this author's achievement.",0670846023,9780670846023,128,Alfred Corn, , ,3.67,3,0,Viking Adult,December 1st 1992,Hardcover,English,880-3568851-autobiographies.html

3841,Joking Apart: My Autobiography,"Donncha O’Callaghan is one of Ireland’s leading international rugby players, and a stalwart of the Munster side. He was a key figure in the Irish team which won the IRB 6 Nations Grand Slam in 2009, and has won two Heineken Cup medals and a Magners League title with Munster. But that success did not come easy. For a player who has been capped more than 70 times for Ireland, won two Heineken Cups with Munster, and been on two Lions tours, his long battle to make a breakthrough at the highest level is largely unknown. In this revealing autobiography, Donncha talks in detail about the personal setbacks and disappointments at Munster and the unconventional ways he dealt with the frustration of not making the team for four of five years in his early 20s. He had a parallel experience with Ireland where it took him nearly six years to get from fringe squad member to established first choice player. Here he talks candidly about his relationships with the coaches who overlooked him and the second row rivals who kept him on the bench. Donncha talks with great warmth about a hectic childhood that was shaped by the death of his father when he was only six years old. Unusually for a Cork rugby player, he came from a working class background and one of the heroes of his story is his mother Marie who showed incredible strength and resourcefulness to rear a family of six on her own. Often regarded as ""the joker in the pack,"" Donncha has worked hard, with dedication and intensity, to reach the high standards required of a professional rugby player. There have been many highs and lows along the way. His autobiography is a fascinating account of a storming career, filled with anecdotes about the players and managers he has worked with. This is the full picture, showing sides of the man that will be unfamiliar to followers of Irish rugby and will surprise the reader.",1848270968,9781848270961,352,Donncha O'Callaghan, , ,4.10,30,2,Transworld Publishers,January 1st 2012,Hardcover,English,885-13142495-joking-apart.html

3843,Moving Pictures: An Autobiography,"This is the autobiography of a former photographer's stylist who became an international film celebrity and married two of Hollywood's biggest names, but then seemed to throw it all away. The role of Jenny in ""Love Story"" brought Ali MacGraw stardom. She married producer Bob Evans and bore him a son, but after two years she left Evans for Steve McQueen. McQueen was a troubled man who longed to live simply, almost reclusively, with his wife barefoot and pregnant. At his insistence MacGraw gave up acting at the peak of her fame, making a decision from which her career never recovered. When the tumultuous marriage ended after six years she was not much in demand, and what acting she did, for example in television's ""Dynasty"", was ridiculed - justly, she felt. A lifelong pattern of destructive love affairs continued and her depression was abetted by unacknowledged alcoholism. When a friend persuaded her in 1986 to go to the Betty Ford Clinic, MacGraw felt she needed only a ""tune-up"". What she found instead was life-saving help. Now Ali MacGraw takes stock of her life, revising the mythical childhood she once invented for a ""Time"" cover story and describing the heady early years in New York, her attempted transformation by the Hollywood machine and the realities she faces today as a woman who hopes her greatest adventures are yet to come. ** Publisher's Weekly In this candid, courageous autobiography, MacGraw discusses her artistic, emotionally cold parents, her schooling at Wellesley College and her stint as Diana Vreeland's ``girl'' at Harper's Bazaar . The focus, however, is on her struggle with addiction--alcoholism and ``male dependency''--that grew as her acting career and personal life sputtered. A sudden star in her first major role, in Goodbye, Columbus in 1969, and the following year with the even more popular Love Story. Library Journal - Thomas Wiener McGraw now tells the whole sad story of her life. In what could be appropriately filed under ``self-help,'' she writes extensively about coming to grips with her addictions to alcohol and men. This is certainly not a series of pretty pictures. Entertainment Weekly - Margot Miflin This competently written memoir hinges on McGraw’s discovery that women can be addicted to men. Chicago Tribune - Jon Anderson ""Love Story""; the subject of a Time cover story, ""The Return to Romance""; and the wife, in turn, of two powerful Hollywood figures: Robert Evans, head of production at Paramount, and actor Steve McQueen....McGraw reveals that a lot more action, not all of it happy, was going on off- stage. Los Angeles Times - Constance Casey ""Moving Pictures"" demonstrates that underneath all that shallow stuff, lies ""an ordinary human heart.""",, ,0,Ali MacGraw, , ,3.36,33,1,Renaissance Literary & Talent in collaboration with the Proprietor,March 14th 2015,Kindle Edition,English,887-25179180-moving-pictures.html

3845,Outside the Magic Circle: The Autobiography of Virginia Foster Durr,"Virginia Foster Durr is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister, and she was raised in Birmingham during the early years of this century. She attended Wellesley for two years, until her family’s circumstances made it impossible for her to continue. Virginia’s sister Josephine married Hugo Black; and in 1926 Virginia married a young lawyer named Clifford Durr. The Durrs moved to Washington shortly after Roosevelt’s inauguration, and Clifford was one of the “bright young lawyers” whom the new president relied upon to draft the legislation establishing the New Deal. After World War II the Durrs moved to Denver, then to Montgomery, where Clifford became one of the few white lawyers to represent blacks in civil rights cases. During the Durrs’ Washington years Virginia had been active in the movement to abolish the poll tax and in to her liberal causes; and back in Montgomery, she shared Clifford’s commitment to the civil rights movement and served as an inspiration to liberals of both races. Virginia Durr has succeeded in articulating the pleasures and the difficulties of growing up female in the vigorous young city of Birmingham; the broadening (and in some ways also restricting) of young women’s intellectual horizons and social life at Wellesley; and the excitement of the courtship and marriage of a proper young Southern girl of good family and poor circumstance. She brings to life the social and political climate of Washington during the New Deal and war years, where her close connection to Justice Black gave the Durrs access to people whom they might not have come to know otherwise. A victim of McCarthyism, Clifford returned with Virginia to Montgomery with no job and few prospects. Their decision to become engaged in the civil rights struggle was consistent with their lifelong commitment to follow their consciences, regardless of the social and economic consequences. “Virginia Durr said it: there were three ways for a well brought-up young Southern white woman to go. She could be the actress, playing out the stereotype of the Southern belle. Gracious to ‘the colored help,’ flirtatious to her powerful father-in-law, and offering a sweet, winning smile to the world. In short, going with the wind. If she had a spark of independence or worse, creativity, she could go crazy—on the dark, shadowy street traveled by more than one Southern belle. Or she could be the rebel. She could step outside the magic circle, abandon privilege, and challenge this way of life. Ostracism, bruised of all sorts, and defamation would be her lot. Her reward would be a truly examined life. And a world she would otherwise never have known.” — from the Foreword by Studs Terkel",0817305173,9780817305178,380,Virginia Foster Durr,Hollinger F.

3847,Alan Carr Autobiography,"The brilliantly funny and inimitable Alan Carr tells his life story in his own words, from growing up in a football-mad family in Northampton to his rise to become one of Britain’s best-loved comedians.‘Puberty had been unkind. Whereas it had come in the night and left the other boys with chiselled, stubbly chins and deep masculine voices, I’d been left with a huge pair of knockers and the voice of a pensioner.’ Alan CarrAlan Carr grew up in one of the most boring towns in England – Northampton. A place known for making shoes. It was also known for its football club, Northampton Town FC. Alan’s dad as manager of the club was a local hero. A dream come true for most lads, but not Alan. Alan wore glasses and had man boobs at 14. He did not like P.E.In his very first book, Alan tells his life story, (‘oh and what a life’) with his unique twist of natural, observational humour –‘I’m not saying I’m a fantasist but there have been times when things that I’ve seen on television when I was younger have tended to seep into my subconscious and blended into my own life. I remember telling my Mum about the time I stopped that woman from having a diamond encrusted necklace stolen and she’d say ‘No Alan, that was Poirot.’With his tongue-in-cheek, end of pier humour that made him famous, Alan describes an ordinary life in bursts of technicolour. His journey from awkward schoolboy hiding his man-boobs on the pitch, drinking tea with the dinner ladies and working in a call centre, to becoming one of our best-loved comedians likened to the great Frankie Howerd, will make his book a guaranteed tickler with a laugh-out-loud gag on every page. Alan Carr was born in Weymouth in 1976 and grew up mainly in Northampton. He is famously the son of football manager Graham Carr. He won the BBC New Comedian of the Year in 2001 and his 2007 stand-up tour, filmed for his DVD Tooth Fairy, released at Christmas; was a nation-wide sell-out. Alan has homes in London and Manchester.",0007287801,9780007287802,320,Alan Carr, , ,3.82,1890,118,HarperCollins,October 6th 2008,Hardcover, ,890-3937782-alan-carr-autobiography.html

3849,How NOT to be a Football Millionaire - Keith Gillespie My Autobiography,"KEITH GILLESPIE is renowned as a footballer who liked a bet. And lost a lot. One afternoon he added up how much he had squandered during the course of his professional career. It made for uncomfortable reading... Manchester United £60,000 Newcastle United £1,102,000 Blackburn Rovers £3,510,000 Leicester City £1,050,000 Sheffield United £670,000 Bradford City £15,000 Glentoran £43,875 Total (plus extras) £7,215,875 That day seemed a world away from 1993 when he burst on to the scene as a fresh-faced young star with Manchester United. A dark-haired lad from the streets of Northern Ireland with a God-given talent, he was dubbed the new George Best. One of the famous Fergie fledglings, he made his debut aged just 17 before moving on to Kevin Keegan’s Newcastle where he came so close to landing a Premiership title winner’s medal. International caps piled up too. It was a thrilling adventure. Flying down the wing and sharing pitches and dressing rooms with legends, but behind the success and glamour, it was a different story. Like Best, Gillespie had a talent for self-destruction. He liked a drink and there were women but they weren’t causing a big problem – it was keeping hold of the millions he had earned from the game that ultimately proved his downfall. It wasn’t just about gambling. A nightmare ordeal during a training break in La Manga landed him in jail for a crime he did not commit. Then, in 2010, Gillespie became headline news again when a series of flawed business deals saw him declared bankrupt. How Not To Be A Football Millionaire is one of the most honest autobiographies you will read, about a player who lived the football life to the full. It tells a fascinating and moving human story of the darker side of the glory game. About winning and losing, fortune and fate, hope and heartache...

After the tides of violence turned with such force that her alter ego emerged as her only guardian, Devon's downward spiral hurtled her towards a dangerous decision she now has only one day to change before someone's life ends. ﻿ ﻿Inspired by a true story, The Fall is a cautionary tale that explores dependencies, disorders, and domestic abuse from the vantage point of a young girl who at times must separate from herself entirely in order to endure.

3856,Billy the Kid: An Autobiography,"In 1882 a notorious outlaw by the name of Jesse Evans, a childhood friend of Billy the Kid and a participant in the Lincoln County War, walked out of jail after serving a 10 year sentence for killing a Texas ranger. Jesse walked out of prison a free man and disappeared, never to be heard from again. Never, that is, until 1949 when Jesse came out of hiding after almost 60 years to claim an inheritance left to him by his brother. In the course of proving his identity to a court Jesse told some amazing stories of his time when he was an outlaw but his biggest revelation of all was that his good friend Billy the Kid was still alive. Jesse led a young lawyer named William Morrison to an old man named not William H. Bonney but William H. Roberts who after some consideration finally agreed to come forward and reveal himself as Billy the Kid. He agreed to this on one condition. This condition was not that he could receive fame, fortune, or royalties on a book, but this condition was that he would reveal himself only if he could obtain a pardon from the Governor before his death so he could die a free man. You see, Billy the Kid was still wanted for murder and was condemned to hang. To come forward and reveal himself was to risk being arrested and put to death. This was a risk that William H. Roberts was willing to take. He sat down with Mr. Morrison and told his story. This book contains that story. It is the one true autobiography of Billy the Kid. A story that aside from some definite highlights and adventures that one would expect from the Kid, was remarkable normal and focused on his skill breaking horses as much or as more as his skill as a gunslinger. Billy the Kid was, in fact, just a gifted young cowhand who found himself juxtaposed against corrupt officials and lawmen at what became a key moment in American History. Before one dismisses Mr. Roberts it should be considered that 5 living acquaintances of Billy the Kid, aside from Mr. Evans who revealed him, were willing to sign legal affidavits that Mr. Roberts was the man they knew as Billy the Kid. Further, new photographic evidences shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that they were the same man. Mr. Roberts' story became the inspiration for the opening scene in hit movie ""Young Guns II"" starring Emilio Estevez as Billy the Kid. Also Consider that Pat Garrett was denied his reward for killing the kid for many months, and that only a special act of the legislature allowed him to finally receive it. Consider further that a contemporary newspaper reported, after seeing the body of the kid, that the Kid had tanned his skin and grown a beard to disguise himself as a Mexican which fits perfectly the local history that Pat Garrett killed the wrong man. All of this and more is contained in this book. Thanks to Mr. Morrison each of us can now pull up a chair, sit down across from Billy the Kid, and listen as he shares his story.",, ,234,Daniel A.

3859,Will & Ariel Durant: A Dual Autobiography,"In this magnificently readable autobiography by the authors of The Story of Civilization, Will and Ariel Durant celebrate and examine a lifetime of ideas, friendships, triumphs and love. The story of their life together, rich in brilliant anecdotes and with the names of the countless famous people they knew, is a passionate record of their shared experience as lovers, as husband and wife, as world travelers, and as the authors of one of the most famous and successful works of scholarship in American literary history. Ariel and Will Durant met and fell in love in 1912. He was a teacher at the anarchist Ferrer Center in New York, a young man already in love with the world of ideas, who had quit the seminary (to his family's chagrin) in search of freedom. She was fourteen years old, so young that she roller-skated on her way to City Hall for her marriage, the daughter of penniless immigrants struggling to survive in the New World, inheritor of all the rebellious traditions and the determination to survive of the Russian ghetto from which her family came. Together they shared not only a burning love for each other but a passionate hunger for ideas. Their book takes us with them on their incredible and fascinating intellectual journey, beginning with their interest in anarchism (which brought them close to Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman) and going on through a long, shared lifetime that brought them honors, fame and the acquaintanceship of almost every major literary and intellectual personality in Europe and the United States. Their book is remarkably frank and deeply moving, at once a star-studded history of the decades through which they lived and worked and a passionate, intimate and powerful tribute to a great and enduring love.""",, ,420,Will Durant,Ariel Durant, ,4.69,13,2,Simon & Schuster,November 15th 1977,Hardcover,English,901-19886534-will-ariel-durant.html
3860,No Holding Back: The Autobiography,"As one of the fastest bowlers the world has seen, Michael Holding claimed 249 Test wickets and went by the haunting nickname ""Whispering Death""—a moniker earned because he advanced on the bowling crease with stealth-like malevolence. Despite having not laced his bowling boots since 1989, it remains a fitting sobriquet. As a commentator and administrator, Holding has delivered his views on cricket in the same manner that he played the game: he speaks softly with a rich Jamaican rhythm and is calculated in either criticism or compliment. This book charts his effortless transition from one of the great players to one of the great pundits. Holding graphically describes his days as a player, looking back at how he tried to deliberately hurt batsmen on the wastelands of Kingston and his first match for Jamaica when he almost collapsed from exhaustion—after only four overs! He also divulges what it was like to tour with West Indies, and shares unmissable insights about sharing a dressing room with other legends of the game like Sir Clive Lloyd, Sir Viv Richards, and Malcolm Marshall. Holding does not shirk the big issues—he explores why West Indies have slipped following their halcyon days, openly assesses Brian Lara, and laments the hypocrisy over the state of the game in the region. The controversy surrounding the Allen Stanford $20m spectacle, the ICC's handling of the abandoned England vs. Pakistan match, player power, illegal bowling actions, and the threat of Twenty20 to the Test game are all subjects which Holding tackles with knowledge and class.",0297859358,9780297859352,256,Michael Holding, , ,3.74,19,2,Orion Publishing,August 1st 2010,Hardcover,English,902-8885180-no-holding-back.html

He went on to attain success as a songwriter on Broadway and as the compiler of the definitive Book of American Negro Spirituals . But he achieved one of his greatest triumphs in 1912, when, under a pseudonym, he published The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man —a classic novel about a musician who rejects his black roots, a novel that is still in print today in multiple paperback editions. Johnson went on to be, from 1920 to 1930, the first African-American head of the NAACP, fighting tirelessly for the passage of a federal anti-lynching law.

3863,Will: The Autobiography of Will Greenwood,"Known as Shaggy to his mates, Greenwood is one of rugby's and international sport's most engaging, intelligent, outspoken and witty characters. A Lancastrian to the tips of this size 12 boots, the giant centre has been an automatic choice in the England XV since his debut against Australia in 1997. A few months earlier he looked set to become only the third uncapped Englishman to play for the British Lions when he came within a whisker of losing his life after he was speared to the ground in a heavy tackle, lost consciousness and swallowed his tongue. After taking several months to recover he quickly made an impact at international level following a widespread clamour in the press for his call-up to the England side. An elegant riposte to the old jibe that England rugby players lack guile and imagination, the Harlequins' and former Leicester centre has brought a shimmering, magical quality to his team's back play, opening up defences with clever angled running, superb distribution and a gravity-defying ability to stay up in the tackle.

3878,Autobiography of an Aspiring Saint (The Other Voice in Early Modern Europe: The Chicago Series),"Charged by the Venetian Inquisition with the conscious and cynical feigning of holiness, Cecelia Ferrazzi (1609-1684) requested and obtained the unprecedented opportunity to defend herself through a presentation of her life story. Ferrazzi's unique inquisitorial autobiography and the transcripts of her preceding testimony, expertly transcribed and eloquently translated into English, allow us to enter an unfamiliar sector of the past and hear 'another voice'—that of a humble Venetian woman who had extraordinary experiences and exhibited exceptional courage. Born in 1609 into an artisan family, Cecilia Ferrazzi wanted to become a nun. When her parents' death in the plague of 1630 made it financially impossible for her to enter the convent, she refused to marry and as a single laywoman set out in pursuit of holiness. Eventually she improvised a vocation: running houses of refuge for ""girls in danger,"" young women at risk of being lured into prostitution. Ferrazzi's frequent visions persuaded her, as well as some clerics and acquaintances among the Venetian elite, that she was on the right track. The socially valuable service she was providing enhanced this impresssion. Not everyone, however, was convinced that she was a genuine favorite of God. In 1664 she was denounced to the Inquisition. The Inquisition convicted Ferrazzi of the pretense of sanctity. Yet her autobiographical act permits us to see in vivid detail both the opportunities and the obstacles presented to seventeenth-century women.",0226244474,9780226244471,136,Cecilia Ferrazzi,Anne Jacobson Schutte, ,3.83,12,2,University Of Chicago Press,December 15th 1996,Paperback,English,919-883301.Autobiography_of_an_Aspiring_Saint.html

3883,From the Fair: The Autobiography of Sholom Aleichem,"Sholom Aleichem (1859-1916) began writing his autobiography when he was 49 and was still working on it when he died at age 57. He considered From the Fair his greatest achievement, a book that combined the story of his life and a cultural and spiritual history of his times. Aleichem called it “my book of books, the Song of Songs of my soul.” In 1908, a Russian newspaper in Kiev asked for an autobiographical sketch, and Sholom decided to use a third-person narrative voice for what became a memoir. From the Fair was published in short installments, serialized for newspaper readers. It takes us from the author’s childhood in a Pale of Settlement shtetl to his first love and his early attempts at writing fiction and drama. “I, Sholom Aleichem the writer, will tell the true story of Sholom Aleichem the man,” he writes, “informally and without adornments and embellishments, as if an absolute stranger were talking, yet one who accompanied him everywhere, even to the seven divisions of hell.” The result is essential background for Aleichem’s works of fiction. Curt Leviant is a prizewinning novelist, author of The Yemenite Girl and Passion in the Desert. His short stories and novellas have been published in many magazines and have been included in Best American Short Stories, Prize Stories and other anthologies. He has won the Wallant Prize, an O.

3885,I Dreamed I Was a Very Clean Tramp: An Autobiography,"The sharp, lyrical, and no-holds-barred autobiography of the iconoclastic writer and musician Richard Hell, charting the childhood, coming of age, and misadventures of an artist in an indelible era of rock and roll... From an early age, Richard Hell dreamed of running away. His father died when he was seven, and at seventeen he left his mother and sister behind and headed for New York City, place of limitless possibilities. He arrived penniless with the idea of becoming a poet; ten years later he was a pivotal voice of the age of punk, starting such seminal bands as Television, the Heartbreakers, and Richard Hell and the Voidoids—whose song ""Blank Generation"" remains the defining anthem of the era. Hell was significantly responsible for creating CBGB as punk ground zero; his Voidoids toured notoriously with the Clash, and Malcolm McLaren would credit Hell as inspiration for the Sex Pistols. There were kinetic nights in New York's club demi-monde, descent into drug addiction, and an ever-present yearning for redemption through poetry, music, and art. ""We lived in the suburbs in America in the fifties,"" Hell writes. ""My roots are shallow. I'm a little jealous of people with strong ethnic and cultural roots. Lucky Martin Scorsese or Art Spiegelman or Dave Chappelle. I came from Hopalong Cassidy and Bugs Bunny and first grade at ordinary Maxwell Elementary."" How this legendary downtown artist went from a prosaic childhood in the idyllic Kentucky foothills to igniting a movement that would take over New York's and London's restless youth cultures—and spawn the careers of not only Hell himself, but a cohort of friends such as Tom Verlaine, Patti Smith, the Ramones, and Debbie Harry—is just part of the fascinating story Hell tells. With stunning powers of observation, he delves into the details of both the world that shaped him and the world he shaped. An acutely rendered, unforgettable coming-of-age story, I Dreamed I Was a Very Clean Tramp evokes with feeling, clarity, and piercing intelligence that classic journey: the life of one who comes from the hinterlands into the city in search of art and passion.",0062190849,9780062190840,304,Richard Hell, , ,3.50,953,159,Ecco,February 18th 2014,Paperback,English,925-18085466-i-dreamed-i-was-a-very-clean-tramp.html

Barnum was actually uttered by a competitor of the Barnum & Bailey Circus. While he was referring to the customers of that famous circus, the saying could certainly be attributed equally to that period of time when mining and oil stocks were exploding on the exchanges early in the first and second decade of the 1900's. Gold and silver mines (both real and paper) were capturing interest in investment popularity and touted every day as well as this country's fledgling oil discoveries. The west was being heavily mined and there were unlimited opportunities to place hard-earned dollars in the hopes of reaping many thousands in return. This autobiographical account written almost 80 years ago follows the crazy roller-coaster ride of a mining stock gambler on a get-rich quick plan from early 1900 through the first world war, post-crash, and depression.

Best known for the wacky humor of the Goodies, and the irrepressible enthusiasm of his nature programs, off screen there has been a darker side. Bill has suffered from bouts of depression which have more than once taken him to the brink. Now he is back in control and wiser about the causes and the cure. Here he describes the childhood blighted by the absence of his mother who had been committed to a mental asylum when he was small. It was a lonely and difficult start to life, but there were to be happier times. Touring with the Cambridge Footlights in the 1960s saw him alongside the greatest comic talents of his generation—John Cleese and of course fellow Goodies Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden. Soon the Goodies were to become one of the biggest comedy hits of the 1970s—bringing a new brand of surreal humor to our screens. Now as Britain's favorite birdwatcher Bill has turned his private passion into his most public role and hosted more than 20 nature programs for the BBC. He has also become a fervent and outspoken campaigner for the environment. It has been an extraordinary and far from straightforward journey.

3890,Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas (Maya Angelou's Autobiography #3),"In this third self-contained volume of her autobiography, which began with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Maya Angelou moves into the adult world, and the white world as well, as she marries, enters show business, and tours Europe and Africa in Porgy and Bess. As the book opens, Maya, in order to support herself and her young son, gets a job in a record shop run by a white woman. Suspicious of almost any kindness shown her, she is particularly confused by the special attentions of a young white customer. Soon the relationship grows into love and then marriage, and Maya believes a permanent relationship is finally possible. But it is not to be, and she is again forced to look for work. This time she finds a job as a dancer in a sleazy San Francisco bar. Her remarkable talent, however, soon brings her attention of a different kind, and before long she is singing in one of the most popular nightclubs on the coast. From there, she is called to New York to join the cast of Porgy and Bess, which is just about to begin another tour abroad. The troupe's joyous and dramatic adventure through Italy, France, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Egypt becomes the centerpiece of Singin' and Swingin'. This remarkable portrayal of one of the most exciting and talented casts ever put together, and of the encounters between these larger-than-life personalities and audiences who had rarely seen black people before, makes a hilarious and poignant story. The excitement of the journey -- full of camaraderie, love affairs, and memorable personalities -- is dampened only by Maya's nagging guilt that she has once again abandoned the person she loves most in life, her son. Back home, and driven close to suicide by her guilt and concern, she takes her son with her to Hawaii, where she discovers that devotion and love, in spite of forced absence, have the power to heal and sustain. As always, Maya Angelou's writing is charged with that remarkable sense of life and love and unique celebration of the human condition that have won her such a loyal following.",0679457771,9780679457770,288,Maya Angelou, , ,4.20,4109,136,Random House,May 13th 1997,Hardcover,English,93-130957.Singin_and_Swingin_and_Gettin_Merry_Like_Christmas.html
3891,Weeds in Bloom: Autobiography of an Ordinary Man,"With over 65 books published, including the breathtaking (and somewhat autobiographical) A Day No Pigs Would Die , Robert Newton Peck has enjoyed an illustrious writing career. Now, in an autobiography as unique as he is, Peck tells his story through the people in his life. From his roots as a poor Vermont farmer’s son to his years as a soldier in World War II, from his time slogging away in a paper mill to his semi-retirement in Florida, Peck shows us people who too often go unseen and unheard–the country’s poor and uneducated. “For decades, I’ve examined the autobiographies of my fellow authors. Bah! Many could have been titled And Then I Wrote . . . So instead of my life and lit, here is the unusual, a tarnished treasury of plain people who enriched me, taught me virtues, and helped me hold a mite of manhood.

3896,Leading from the Front: An autobiography,"As Chief of the General Staff, Sir Richard Dannatt was in overall command of the British army for the three years from 2006. This period saw some of the fiercest fighting yet in Afghanistan, and new and increased pressures and expectation placed on the army. From his very first day in the job General Dannatt proved himself a courageous leader and a forceful advocate for the army, never shying from controversy to tell it as he found it. Dannatt's distinguished career in the army has spanned thirty-eight years and seen him serve in many different theatres of conflict, from Northern Ireland (where he was awarded the Military Cross) to Bosnia and Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan. His experiences forged his unwavering loyalty to the fighting British soldier. More than any leader in recent times, Dannatt has used his position of command to argue for improved pay and conditions for British soldiers, a greater dialogue between the army and the country, the right equipment for the troops to do the job asked of them, and greater welfare and support back home for the wounded. His leadership has shaped the debate about the role of a modern army in modern warfare. Leading from the Front is Richard Dannatt's fascinating reflection on a life of military service and offers his characteristically frank analysis of whether Britain's defence strategy is fit to respond to the threats we will face in the 21st century.",0593066367,9780593066362,432,Dannatt, , ,3.78,18,2,Bantam Press,September 16th 2010,Hardcover,English,935-9274782-leading-from-the-front.html

3898,Out of My Mind: An Autobiography,"Kristin Nelson Tinker began to paint in 1962 at the young age of seventeen, after seeing a collection of American primitive paintings at the home of her future in-laws, Ozzie and Harriet Nelson. The eldest daughter of the legendary football star Tom Harmon and actress Elyse Knox, who appeared in fifty feature films before retiring to raise her children, Tinker grew up in a Hollywood family of competition, achievement, and celebrity. Before she was twenty, she had married Ricky Nelson and was appearing regularly in America's favorite TV show, ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet."" Thus began an eventful journey through the decades of postwar America, following a pattern of feeling and experience that will resonate powerfully with readers of Tinker's generation. She uses paintings and family photographs, as well as diary entries, her own poems, and well-chosen selections from contemporary songs and poems to tell the story of her life: of growing up in the 1950s in a formidable family that - like the nation at large - papered over the reality of emotional pain and conflict with the image of happiness; of a marriage to a gifted man who got lost on the way to adulthood; and of her later struggles as a single parent, her intense emotional crisis and recovery, and her increasingly strong belief in herself as an artist. In more than one hundred joyous paintings, she portrays thirty years of American dreaming: weddings and birthdays; Halloweens and Christmases; rambling houses and broad suburban lawns; hippie idylls and lively LA street scenes; vacationing on Martha's Vineyard and ice skating in New York; rock concerts, football games, and backyard basketball; volleyball and barbecues on thebeach and fireworks bursting over the water; along with a moving record of the great (and, occasionally, the not-so-great) moments in her family history.",0810936917,9780810936911,230,Kristin Nelson Tinker, , ,4.22,27,5,ABRAMS,October 1st 1997,Hardcover,English,937-178952.Out_of_My_Mind.html

3906,Undisputed Truth: My Autobiography,"A bare-knuckled, tell-all memoir from Mike Tyson, the onetime heavyweight champion of the world—and a legend both in and out of the ring. Philosopher, Broadway headliner, fighter, felon—Mike Tyson has defied stereotypes, expectations, and a lot of conventional wisdom during his three decades in the public eye. Bullied as a boy in the toughest, poorest neighborhood in Brooklyn, Tyson grew up to become one of the most thrilling and ferocious boxers of all time—and the youngest heavyweight champion ever. But his brilliance in the ring was often compromised by reckless behavior. Years of hard partying, violent fights, and criminal proceedings took their toll: by 2003, Tyson had hit rock bottom, a convicted felon, completely broke, the punch line to a thousand bad late-night jokes. Yet he fought his way back; the man who once admitted being addicted �to everything” regained his success, his dignity, and the love of his family. With a triumphant one-man stage show, his unforgettable performances in the Hangover films, and his newfound happiness and stability as a father and husband, Tyson’s story is an inspiring American original. Brutally honest, raw, and often hilarious, Tyson chronicles his tumultuous highs and lows in the same sincere, straightforward manner we have come to expect from this legendary athlete. A singular journey from Brooklyn’s ghettos to worldwide fame to notoriety, and, finally, to a tranquil wisdom, Undisputed Truth is not only a great sports memoir but an autobiography for the ages.",0007502516,9780007502516,564,Mike Tyson,Larry Sloman, ,4.03,2170,284,HarperSport,November 21st 2013,Hardcover,English,944-18887108-undisputed-truth.html
3907,Porn King: The Autobiography of John C. Holmes,"In the world of Adult Cinema, one name stands out above all others: John Holmes. For nearly 20 years, from 1967 to 1987, Holmes reigned as the undisputed King of X-rated films, having appeared in a record 2,200-plus productions, from the landmark Johnny Wadd movies to the legendary Insatiable with Marilyn Chambers. To a legion of fans throughout America, Europe and Asia, he was known as ""Mr. Big."" To industry insiders, he was ""Mr. Nice Guy."" Yet for all of his fame and notoriety, Holmes remained an intensely private person and a mystery man. That is until now. In this startingly frank autobiography, PORN KING was written in large part prior to his death (with new material added by his widow, Laurie) Holmes talkes about his incredible life.This is not a typical celebrity story filled with bright lights and movie moguls. It is, instead, a rare portrait of a young man drawn into an unknown Hollywood, a secret, forbidden Hollywood, and the parallels between his astounding career and the sexual revolution in American Films. Holmes knew his subject better then anyone. Holmes candidly tells of a lucrative but often harrowing ""other"" life as a male prostitute to the rich and famous, international society matrons, politicians' wives, debutantes and actresses; a shattering fall into drugs and his involvements with dealers, organized crime, rock and screen stars; and a desperate cross-country flight following his implication in the grisly ""Laurel Canyon - Four on the Floor"" Murders. From start to finish, ""PORN KING"" is a sizzling, sensuous, fast-paced story laced with controversy. It is at times raw, violent, even filled with pain. During his lifetime, John Holmes wentthrough hell and back, and he had the emotional scars to prove it. John C. Holmes will without a doubt go down in our History Books. This is a definate must read book that any reader will have a hard time putting down.

With Alone atop the Hill , Carol McCabe Booker has condensed Dunnigan’s 1974 self-published autobiography to appeal to a general audience and has added scholarly annotations that provide historical context. Dunnigan’s dynamic story reveals her importance to the fields of journalism, women’s history, and the civil rights movement and creates a compelling portrait of a groundbreaking American. Dunnigan recounts her formative years in rural Kentucky as she struggled for a living, telling bluntly and simply what life was like in a Border State in the first half of the twentieth century. Later she takes readers to Washington, D.C., where we see her rise from a typist during World War II to a reporter. Ultimately she would become the first black female reporter accredited to the White House; to travel with a U.S. president; credentialed by the House and Senate Press Galleries; accredited to the Department of State and the Supreme Court; voted into the White House Newswomen’s Association and the Women’s National Press Club; and recognized as a Washington sports reporter. A contemporary of Helen Thomas and a forerunner of Ethel Payne, Dunnigan traveled with President Truman on his coast-to-coast, whistle-stop tour; was the first reporter to query President Eisenhower about civil rights; and provided front-page coverage for more than one hundred black newspapers of virtually every race issue before the Congress, the federal courts, and the presidential administration. Here she provides an uninhibited, unembellished, and unvarnished look at the terrain, the players, and the politics in a rough-and-tumble national capital struggling to make its way through a nascent, postwar racial revolution.",0820347981,9780820347981,240,Alice Dunnigan,Carol McCabe Booker,Simeon Booker,4.00,2,1,University of Georgia Press,February 15th 2015,Hardcover, ,951-23282375-alone-atop-the-hill.html

In his eight years with the club he came to embody their aspirations to such an extent that he was embraced as their on-field representative, the supporter on the pitch.

His stories of growing up in the sectarian violence of Belfast will shock many, whereas the determination he showed when rebuilding his life when his footballing career was destroyed by injury will act as an inspiration. His career is littered with unforgetable moments, among them the astonishing performance of the seventeen-year-old usurper of Pele's 'youngest ever' World Cup record as Northern Ireland beat Spain in Valencia in 1982.",0755315987,9780755315987,352,Norman Whiteside, , ,3.31,16,0,Headline,March 6th 2008,Paperback,English,965-4052552-determined.html

Invasion of the Body Snatchers is one of the very few acknowledged science-fiction classics, and Magnum Force - with its catch-phrase 'Make my day' - has become part of our modern consciousness.

3949,"My Life, as I See It: An Autobiography","Dionne Warwick made her singing debut in church at the request of her grandfather, the Reverend Elzae Warrick, when she was six years old. No one knew then that she would become an international music legend, but what she knew&#8212;as words of wisdom passed down from her grandfather&#8212;was that ""if you can think it, you can do it."" And she did it. Dionne released the first of more than fifty-six charted hits in 1962 with ""Don&#8217;t Make Me Over,"" followed by ""Anyone Who Had a Heart,"" ""Walk On By,"" ""I Say a Little Prayer,"" ""Alfie,"" and ""A House Is Not a Home,"" to name a few.

She was considered the voice of Burt Bacharach/Hal David compositions, and the rest is here, in her first autobiography. Dionne tells the stories of her life from her childhood in East Orange, New Jersey, in a two-family home with her parents, brother, and sister, to now, as she celebrates her fiftieth year in show business.

Her mother, Lee Drinkard Warrick, was a founding member of the legendary Drinkard Jubilairs, which included her mother&#8217;s siblings Cissy, Marie, Annie, Nick, and Larry.

Her father, once a Pullman porter, became an accountant, went on to promote gospel records for Hob Records, and wrote a book on gospel music.

3955,The Autobiography of Osugi Sakae,"In the Japanese labor movement of the early twentieth century, no one captured the public imagination as vividly as Osugi Sakae (1885-1923): rebel, anarchist, and martyr. Flamboyant in life, dramatic in death, Osugi came to be seen as a romantic hero fighting the oppressiveness of family and society. Osugi helped to create this public persona when he published his autobiography ( Jijoden ) in 1921-22. Now available in English for the first time, this work offers a rare glimpse into a Japanese boy's life at the time of the Sino-Japanese (1894-95) and the Russo-Japanese (1904-5) wars. It reveals the innocent—and not-so-innocent—escapades of children in a provincial garrison town and the brutalizing effects of discipline in military preparatory schools. Subsequent chapters follow Osugi to Tokyo, where he discovers the excitement of radical thought and politics. Byron Marshall rounds out this picture of the early Osugi with a translation of his Prison Memoirs (Gokuchuki) , originally published in 1919. This essay, one of the world's great pieces of prison writing, describes in precise detail the daily lives of Japanese prisoners, especially those incarcerated for political crimes.",0520077601,9780520077607,0,Osugi Sakae, , ,3.14,14,1,University of California Press,December 17th 1992,Paperback,English,989-1108537.The_Autobiography_of_Osugi_Sakae.html

The author of this engrossing, suspenseful account is the Australian attorney who represented Wright and his would-be Australian publisher. Excerpts from the trial testimony reveal that Turnbull uncovered mendacity, hypocrisy and cynicism at the highest levels of the British government, principally during his cross-examination of Sir Robert Armstrong, cabinet secretary and adviser on intelligence matters. In 1987 the High Court at Canberra dismissed the case and ordered the Thatcher government to reimburse legal costs to Wright and Heinemann Publishers Australia. Turnbull calls the Britishers' conduct in the affair ""quite disgraceful"" and adds that the experience ""galvanized my determination to see Australia rid herself of its sic remaining constitutional links with England.""",0440201322,9780440201328,496,Peter Maurice Wright, , ,3.68,1889,107,Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group,July 1st 1988,Mass Market Paperback,English,99-971569.Spycatcher.html

They are--in the words of the title of one of the prose pieces--'The Dialogue of the Late Afternoon' of his life. I don't believe any autobiography, with its inevitable implication of self-presentation, could have matched what we have here."" With more than 500,000 copies of his books in print, Naguib Mahfouz has established a following of readers for whom Echoes of an Autobiography provides a unique opportunity to catch an intimate glimpse into the life and mind of this magnificent storyteller. Here, in his first work of nonfiction ever to be published in the United States, Mahfouz considers the myriad perplexities of existence, including preoccupations with old age, death, and life's transitory nature. A surprising and delightful departure from his bestselling and much-loved fiction, this unusual and thoughtful book is breathtaking evidence of the fact that Naguib Mahfouz is not only a ""storyteller of the first order"" ( Vanity Fair ), but also a profound thinker of the first order.",0385485565,9780385485562,144,Naguib Mahfouz,نجيب محفوظ,Denys Johnson-Davies,4.00,1199,223,Anchor,December 29th 1997,Paperback,English,992-5501.Echoes_of_an_Autobiography.html

3962,"The Limits of Autobiography: Trauma, Testimony, Theory","Memoirs in which trauma takes a major-or the major-role challenge the limits of autobiography. Leigh Gilmore presents a series of ""limit-cases""-texts that combine elements of autobiography, fiction, biography, history, and theory while representing trauma and the self-and demonstrates how and why their authors swerve from the formal constraints of autobiography when the representation of trauma coincides with self-representation. Gilmore maintains that conflicting demands on both the self and narrative may prompt formal experimentation by such writers and lead to texts that are not, strictly speaking, autobiography, but are nonetheless deeply engaged with its central concerns.In astute and compelling readings of texts by Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Dorothy Allison, Mikal Gilmore, Jamaica Kincaid, and Jeanette Winterson, Gilmore explores how each of them poses the questions, ""How have I lived? How will I live?"" in relation to the social and psychic forms within which trauma emerges. Challenging the very boundaries of autobiography as well as trauma, these stories are not told in conventional ways: the writers testify to how self-representation and the representation of trauma grow beyond simple causes and effects, exceed their duration in time, and connect to other forms of historical, familial, and personal pain. In their movement from an overtly testimonial form to one that draws on legal as well as literary knowledge, such texts produce an alternative means of confronting kinship, violence, and self-representation.",0801486742,9780801486746,176,Leigh Gilmore, , ,3.79,14,0,Cornell University Press,January 4th 2001,Paperback,English,995-424109.The_Limits_of_Autobiography.html

From the triumphs and disasters of a life spent in show business, to his unconsummated loves and self-proclaimed yearning for the young. As TS Eliot said of him: 'The mind boggles.",0863697240,9780863697241,256,Groucho Marx,James Thurber, ,4.10,1519,100,Virgin Publ.,2002,Paperback,English,996-1372759.Groucho_Me.html

3966,Glenn Hughes: The Autobiography - From Deep Purple to Black Country Communion,"Vocalist, bassist and songwriter Glenn Hughes is a living, breathing personification of British rock, and the arc of his career and attendant lifestyle make for a compelling story. Starting with the Midlands beat combo Finders Keepers in the 1960s, he formed acclaimed funk-rock band Trapeze in the early 70s before joining Deep Purple at their commercial peak. Flying the world in Starship 1, the band's own Boeing 720 jet, Hughes enthusiastically embraced the rock superstar's lifestyle while playing on three Purple albums, including the classic Burn. When the band split in 1976 Hughes embarked on a breakneck run of solo albums, collaborations and even a brief, chaotic spell fronting Black Sabbath. All of this was accompanied by cocaine psychosis, crack addiction and other excesses, before Hughes survived a clean-up-or-die crisis, and embarked on a reinvigorated solo career enriched by a survivor's wisdom. In his autobiography, Hughes talks us through this whirlwind of a life with unflinching honesty and good humour, taking us right up to date with his triumphant re-emergence in current supergroup Black Country Communion. ""I had a constant fascination with the darkside. It is another world, bordering on insanity, and demonic possession, or what I thought was my own Soul Bending personal nirvana. Its good to be back in the middle of the boat, instead of hanging on for dear life in the last life boat."" - Glenn Hughes, April 2011",1906002924,9781906002923,254,Glenn   Hughes,Joel McIver, ,3.98,80,12,Jawbone Press,November 1st 2011,Paperback,English,999-11493470-glenn-hughes.html
