The family later moved to Leicester where his father was appointed Principal of the university while Richard was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester and at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).His film career began with a role as a deserting sailor inIn Which We Serve(1942), a part that contributed to his being typecast for many years as a coward in films likeDulcimer Street(1948),Operation Disaster(1950) and his breakthrough role as a psychopathic young gangster in the film adaptation ofGraham Greene's novel,Brighton Rock(1948). During World War II, Attenborough served in the Royal Air Force.He worked prolifically in British films for the next 30 years, and in the 1950s appeared in several successful comedies forJohn BoultingandRoy Boulting, includingPrivate's Progress(1956) andI'm All Right Jack(1959). Early in his stage career, Attenborough starred in the London West End production ofAgatha Christie's \\\"The Mousetrap\\\", which went on to become one of the world's longest-running stage productions. Both he and his wife were among the original cast members of the production, which opened in 1952 and (as of 2007) is still running.In the 1960s, he expanded his range of character roles in films such asSeance on a Wet Afternoon(1964) andGuns at Batasi(1964), for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the regimental Sergeant Major. He appeared in the ensemble cast ofThe Great Escape(1963), as Squadron Leader \\\"Roger Bartlett\\\" (\\\"Big X\\\"), the head of the escape committee.In 1967 and 1968, he won back-to-back Golden Globe Awards in the category of Best Supporting Actor, the first time forThe Sand Pebbles(1966), starringSteve McQueen, and the second time forDoctor Dolittle(1967), starringRex Harrison. He would win another Golden Globe for Best Director, forGandhi(1982), in 1983. Six years prior to \\\"Gandhi\\\", he played the ruthless \\\"Gen.

He has never been nominated for an Academy Award in an acting category.He took no acting roles following his appearance inOtto Preminger'sThe Human Factor(1979), until his appearance as the eccentric developer \\\"John Hammond\\\" inSteven Spielberg'sJurassic Park(1993). The following year, he starred as \\\"Kris Kringle\\\" inMiracle on 34th Street(1994), a remake of the 1947 classic. Since then, he has made occasional appearances in supporting roles, including the historical drama,Elizabeth(1998), as \\\"Sir William Cecil\\\".In the late 1950s, Attenborough formed a production company, \\\"Beaver Films\\\", withBryan Forbesand began to build a profile as a producer on projects, includingThe League of Gentlemen(1960),The Angry Silence(1960) andWhistle Down the Wind(1961), also appearing in the first two of these as an actor.His feature film directorial debut was the all-star screen version of the hit musical,Oh! What a Lovely War(1969), and his acting appearances became more sporadic - the most notable being his portrayal of serial killer \\\"John Christie\\\" in10 Rillington Place(1971). He later directed two epic period films:Young Winston(1972), based on the early life ofWinston Churchill, andA Bridge Too Far(1977), an all-star account of Operation Market Garden in World War II. He won the 1982 Academy Award for Directing for his historical epic,Gandhi(1982), a project he had been attempting to get made for many years. As the film's producer, he also won the Academy Award for Best Picture. His most recent films, as director and producer, includeChaplin(1992), starringRobert Downey Jr.asCharles Chaplin, andShadowlands(1993), based on the relationship betweenC.S. Lewisand Joy Gresham.

He passionately believes in education, primarily education that does not judge upon color, race, creed or religion. His attachment to Waterford is his passion for non-racial education, which were the grounds on which Waterford Kamhlaba was founded. Waterford was one of his inspirations for directingCry Freedom(1987), based on the life of Steve Biko.He was elected to the post of Chancellor of the University of Sussex on 20 March 1998, replacing the Duke of Richmond and Gordon. A lifelong supporter of Chelsea Football Club, Attenborough served as a director of the club from 1969-1982 and, since 1993, has held the honorary position of Life Vice President.

His grandson, Samuel Holland, and granddaughter, Alice Holland, also read in the service.Attenborough's father was principal of University College, Leicester, now the city's university. This has resulted in a long association with the university, with Lord Attenborough a patron. A commemorative plaque was placed on the floor of Richmond Parish Church. The university's \\\"Richard Attenborough Centre for Disability and the Arts\\\", which opened in 1997, is named in his Honor.His son,Michael Attenborough, is also a director. He has two younger brothers, the famous naturalist SirDavid Attenboroughand John Attenborough, who has made a career in the motor trade.He has collectedPablo Picassoceramics since the 1950s.

He is also the first Mexican-born director to have won the Prix de la mise en scene or best director award at Cannes (2006), the second one being Carlos Reygadas in 2012. His six feature films, 'Amores Perros' (2000), '21 Grams' (2003), 'Babel' (2006), 'Biutiful' (2010), 'Birdman' (2014) and 'The Revenant' (2015), have gained critical acclaim world-wide including two Academy Award nominations.Alejandro Gonz\\u00e1lez I\\u00f1\\u00e1rritu was born in Mexico City.Crossing the Atlantic Ocean on a cargo ship at the ages of seventeen and nineteen years, Gonz\\u00e1lez I\\u00f1\\u00e1rritu worked his way across Europe and Africa. He himself has noted that these early travels as a young man have had a great influence on him as a film-maker. The setting of his films have often been in the places he visited during this period.After his travels, Gonz\\u00e1lez I\\u00f1\\u00e1rritu returned to Mexico City and majored in communications at Universidad Iberoamericana. In 1984, he started his career as a radio host at the Mexican radio station WFM, a rock and eclectic music station. In 1988, he became the director of the station. Over the next five years, Gonz\\u00e1lez I\\u00f1\\u00e1rritu spent his time interviewing rock stars, transmitting live concerts, and making WFM the number one radio station in Mexico. From 1987 to 1989, he composed music for six Mexican feature films. He has stated that he believes music has had a bigger influence on him as an artist than film itself.In the nineties, Gonz\\u00e1lez I\\u00f1\\u00e1rritu created Z films with Raul Olvera in Mexico. Under Z Films, he started writing, producing and directing short films and advertisements. Making the final transition into T.V Film directing, he studied under well-known Polish theatre director Ludwik Margules, as well as Judith Weston in Los Angeles.In 1995, Gonz\\u00e1lez I\\u00f1\\u00e1rritu wrote and directed his first T.V pilot for Z Films, called Detras del dinero, -\\\"Behind the Money\\\", starring Miguel Bos\\u00e9.

It was presented at Cannes 2006, where Gonz\\u00e1lez I\\u00f1\\u00e1rritu earned the Best Director Prize (Prix de la mise en sc\\u00e8ne).
